#
# AppVeyor configuration to test Net::SSLeay on Windows
#
# If old Perls start to fail, consider skipping the build tests
# completely or see how to test just the distribution package. What we
# do now is to test build environment. What's actually needed,
# especially with older Perls, is just to see if the distribution
# Net::SSLeay package compiles and passes 'make test' successfully.
#
# Various parts collected from:
# cache, install and build_script sections thanks to blogs.perl.org
# entries by eserte and mauke.
#
# 64bit/32bit Strawberry Perl selection thanks to pali's
# github/Email-Address-XS
#
# Using $Config{make} for not needing to know if make is called dmake,
# gmake, etc. from a PerlMonks posting by pyrt.

# 2017 is Windows Server 2016, earlier are 2012R2
image:
  - Visual Studio 2017
  - Visual Studio 2015

# There's also Any CPU. Note: this does not select 32bit or 64bit
# OS. Both server versions are 64bit and this seems to be related to
# Visual Studio configuration. We use this to choose either 64bit or
# 32bit Strawberry Perl.
platform:
  - x64
  - x86

# Environment variables need to:
# - use defaults for external tests and other Makefile.PL prompts
# - make sure that we use OpenSSL from Strawberry Perl instead of, for
#   example, c:\OpenSSL-Win32 that comes pre-installed on the VM.
# Additional variables in matrix are needed because:
# - old Strawberry Perls don't have cpanm
# - on server 2012R2 image's MinGW was causing linking problems with
#   Strawberry Perl's MinGW.
# - See 1.86 developer builds for config that did more with cpanm.
