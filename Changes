Revision history for Perl extension Net::SSLeay.

????
	- Pass RAND_seed()'s sole argument to the underlying RAND_seed() function in
	  libcrypto, rather than passing the value of a non-existent second argument.
	  Fixes GH-427. Thanks to cgf1 for the report.
	- Avoid explicit and implicit use of weak hash algorithms,
	  such as MD5 and SHA-1, in test suite. This allows tests
	  44_sess.t and 45_exporter.t to correctly work on systems
	  where crypto policies prohibit their direct use and TLS
	  versions that require them. An example of such a system is
	  Rocky Linux 9.2. Any Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and derived
	  system is likely to have similar behaviour.  Thanks to Paul
	  Howarth for the investigation and patches.
	- LibreSSL 3.8.0 release notes state: The POLICY_TREE and its
	  related structures and API were removed. The affected
	  Net::SSLeay functions are:
	  - X509_policy_level_get0_node
	  - X509_policy_level_node_count
	  - X509_policy_node_get0_parent
	  - X509_policy_node_get0_policy
	  - X509_policy_node_get0_qualifiers
	  - X509_policy_tree_free
	  - X509_policy_tree_get0_level
	  - X509_policy_tree_get0_policies
	  - X509_policy_tree_get0_user_policies
	  - X509_policy_tree_level_count
	  Patch by GitHub user orbea.
	- Add OpenSSL 3.1 and LibreSSL 3.7 minor releases to GitHub CI testing.
	  Update the previous minor releases to their latest versions. Add
	  NetBSD to BSDs job and update the other BSDs and Alpine Linux jobs to
	  cover additional and latest releases. Use the latest MacOS runners.
	- Expose SSL_CTX_set_client_hello_cb for setting a callback
	  the server calls when it processes a ClientHello. Expose the
	  following functions that can be called only from the
	  callback. None of these are available with LibreSSL.
	  - SSL_client_hello_isv2
	  - SSL_client_hello_get0_legacy_version
	  - SSL_client_hello_get0_random
	  - SSL_client_hello_get0_session_id
	  - SSL_client_hello_get0_ciphers
	  - SSL_client_hello_get0_compression_methods
	  - SSL_client_hello_get1_extensions_present
	  - SSL_client_hello_get_extension_order
	  - SSL_client_hello_get0_ext
	- Expose constants used by SSL_CTX_set_client_hello_cb related
	  functions.
	  - AD_ prefixed constants naming TLS alert codes for
	    returning from a ClientHello callback or where alert types
	    are used
	  - CLIENT_HELLO_ERROR, CLIENT_HELLO_RETRY and
	    CLIENT_HELLO_SUCCESS for returning from a ClientHello
	    callback
	  - TLSEXT_TYPE_ prefixed contants for naming TLS extension
	    types
	- Expose functions for setting up TLS PSK on the server
	  side. Only SSL_CIPHER_find is available with LibreSSL.
	  - SSL_use_psk_identity_hint
	  - SSL_CTX_use_psk_identity_hint
	  - SSL_set_psk_server_callback
	  - SSL_CTX_set_psk_server_callback
	  - SSL_set_psk_find_session_callback
	  - SSL_CTX_set_psk_find_session_callback
	  - SSL_SESSION_set1_master_key
	  - SSL_SESSION_set_cipher
	  - SSL_SESSION_set_protocol_version
	  - SSL_CIPHER_find
	- Expose NID_shake128, NID_shake256 and the rest of NID_sha* constants.
	- Expose functions for setting up TLS 1.3 PSK authentication
	  on the client side. Only SSL_SESSION_get0_cipher is
	  available with LibreSSL.
	  - SSL_set_psk_use_session_callback
	  - SSL_CTX_set_psk_use_session_callback

	- Major documentation cleanup. Thanks to John Jetmore.

1.93_02 2023-02-22
	- Update ppport.h to version 3.68. This eliminates thousands of
	  compound-token-split-by-macro compiler warnings when building Net-SSLeay with
	  Clang 12 or greater. Partially fixes GH-383.
	- Silence compound-token-split-by-macro warnings when building Net-SSLeay with
	  Clang 12 or greater. Fixes the remainder of GH-383.
	- When building Net-SSLeay, search for the openssl binary in the same directory
	  in which Perl is installed (i.e. $Config{prefix}/bin/). Thanks to Henrik
	  Grimler for the patch.
	- Expose EVP_PKEY_security_bits. Thanks to Felipe Gasper.
	- Major update to Gihub Actions configuration. Thanks to Felipe Gasper.
	  New testing targets are:
	    - OpenSSL and LibreSSL on Alpine Linux on i386, x390x, arm32v6,
	      ar32v7 and arm64v8 architectures.
	    - OpenSSL and LibreSSL on Ubuntu on i386, x390x, ar32v7 and arm64v8
	      architectures.
	    - OpenSSL on FreeBSD 13.0, not enabled yet because of GH #272 and #394
	    - LibreSSL on FreeBSD 13.0
	    - LibreSSL on OpenBSD 6.9
	    - LibreSSL on OpenBSD 7.1
	    - Cygwin on x86_64
	- Fix compilation failure using cl. Microsoft cl compiler do
	  not like when preprocessor directives are inside a
	  macro. Fixes GH-403. Thanks to Jean-Damien Durand.
	- Update CTX_use_PKCS12_file() and CTX_use_PKCS12_file() to
	  use BIO functions for avoiding "no OPENSSL_Applink" runtime
	  errors. Fixes GH-281 and RT#101638. Thanks to Jean-Damien
	  Durand.
	- Add to README.Win32 more information about OPENSSL_Applink
	  and how it may be needed with FILE pointers and POSIX/Unix
	  fds. Recommended method is to avoid them and use OpenSSL BIO
	  functions instead. Update SSLeay.pod with alternatives to
	  Net::SSLeay::SESSION_print_fp(). Closes GH-411.
	- Refactor variable declarations in RSA_generate_key to allow SSLeay.xs to
	  compile under -Werror=declaration-after-statement. Fixes GH-407. Thanks to
	  dharanlinux for the report.
	- Fix memory leaks after calls to X509_get_ext_d2i. Thanks to Anton Borowka.
	- Documentation fix: Correct CRL revocation reasons in
	  P_X509_CRL_add_revoked_serial_hex(). Closes GH-397. Reported
	  by Marc Reisner.
	- Support stable releases of LibreSSL 3.5 and 3.6.
	- Update callback set by SSL_set_session_secret_cb to adjust
	  master secret's length. This is needed with OpenSSL 1.1.1
	  and later that provide buffer that is now longer than 48
	  octets. Fix Net::SSLeay::get_keyblock_size() size
	  calculation with AEAD ciphers. These functions were
	  originally added to OpenSSL and Net::SSLeay for
	  EAP-FAST. These changes allow EAP-FAST to work with AEAD
	  ciphers and with OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and later.
	- Remove code guarded by obsolete
	  SSL_F_SSL_SET_HELLO_EXTENSION #ifdef. This was used by the
	  initial EAP-FAST related OpenSSL patch which was never part
	  of the OpenSSL distribution.
	- PEM_get_string_PrivateKey() currently uses DES-CBC as its
	  default encryption algorithm. Test 33_x509_create_cert.t now
	  skips testing the default algorithm on systems that support
	  providers but don't have the legacy provider available. One
	  such system is FreeBSD 13.0 with OpenSSL which was added as
	  disabled in GitHub actions by PR GH-402 but can now be
	  enabled. Long term fix is to replace DES-CBC with a modern
	  cipher. Allows closing GH-394.

1.93_01 2022-03-20
	- LibreSSL 3.5.0 has removed access to internal data
	  structures: Use X509_get0_tbs_sigalg() and
	  OCSP_SINGLERESP_get0_id() like in OpenSSL 1.1. Also use
	  RSA_get0... with RSA_get_key_parameters(). Thanks to
	  Alexander Bluhm.
	- Expose SSL_CTX_get_min_proto_version(),
	  SSL_CTX_get_max_proto_version(), SSL_get_min_proto_version()
	  and SSL_get_max_proto_version() with LibresSSL 3.4.0 and
	  later. Thanks to Alexander Bluhm.
	- Update tests 07_sslecho.t and 44_sess.t to work around
	  failures seen on Windows with Perls earlier than 5.20. For
	  the details, see GH-356 and look for CloseHandle() in Perl
	  5.20.0 changelog. Thanks to GitHub user twata1 for the
	  report and additional help.
	- Alexander's recent work with RSA_get_key_parameters(),
	  allows to make it available with all OpenSSL versions. It
	  was already available with versions earlier than 1.1.0.
	- Expose BN_dup(), BN_clear(), BN_clear_free() and BN_free().
	- Use PTR2IV instead of direct cast to IV to fix compilation
	  warning with SSLeay.xs internal function bn2sv().
	- Expose X509_CRL_get0_lastUpdate(),
	  X509_CRL_get0_nextUpdate(), X509_CRL_set1_lastUpdate() and
	  X509_CRL_set1_nextUpdate() that became available with
	  OpenSSL 1.1.0 and LibreSSL 2.7.0. These, and the respective
	  deprecated _get/set_ aliases, are available with all OpenSSL
	  and LibreSSL versions. Fixes part of RT#124371.
	- Note in documentation that the X509_CRL_get* functions
	  return a pointer to time structure that should be considered
	  read-only.
	- Use ASN1_STRING_get0_data() instead of ASN1_STRING_data() to
	  avoid compile time deprecation warnings. Partly fixes
	  RT#124371.
	- Add the following constants from Current OpenSSL master branch:
	  - SSL_ASYNC_PAUSED
	  - SSL_ASYNC_NO_JOBS
	  - SSL_CLIENT_HELLO_CB
	  - SSL_ERROR_WANT_ASYNC
	  - SSL_ERROR_WANT_ASYNC_JOB
	  - SSL_ERROR_WANT_CLIENT_HELLO_CB
	  - SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY
	  - SSL_MODE_ASYNC
	  - SSL_MODE_NO_AUTO_CHAIN
	  - SSL_OP_ALLOW_CLIENT_RENEGOTIATION
	  - SSL_OP_CLEANSE_PLAINTEXT
	  - SSL_OP_DISABLE_TLSEXT_CA_NAMES
	  - SSL_OP_ENABLE_KTLS
	  - SSL_OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF
	  - SSL_OP_NO_EXTENDED_MASTER_SECRET
	  - SSL_RETRY_VERIFY
	  - SSL_SESS_CACHE_UPDATE_TIME
	  - X509_TRUST_DEFAULT
	  - X509_V_ERR_AUTHORITY_KEY_IDENTIFIER_CRITICAL
	  - X509_V_ERR_CA_BCONS_NOT_CRITICAL
	  - X509_V_ERR_CA_CERT_MISSING_KEY_USAGE
	  - X509_V_ERR_EC_KEY_EXPLICIT_PARAMS
	  - X509_V_ERR_EMPTY_SUBJECT_ALT_NAME
	  - X509_V_ERR_EMPTY_SUBJECT_SAN_NOT_CRITICAL
	  - X509_V_ERR_EXTENSIONS_REQUIRE_VERSION_3
	  - X509_V_ERR_ISSUER_NAME_EMPTY
	  - X509_V_ERR_KU_KEY_CERT_SIGN_INVALID_FOR_NON_CA
	  - X509_V_ERR_MISSING_AUTHORITY_KEY_IDENTIFIER
	  - X509_V_ERR_MISSING_SUBJECT_KEY_IDENTIFIER
	  - X509_V_ERR_NO_ISSUER_PUBLIC_KEY
	  - X509_V_ERR_PATHLEN_INVALID_FOR_NON_CA
	  - X509_V_ERR_PATHLEN_WITHOUT_KU_KEY_CERT_SIGN
	  - X509_V_ERR_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM_INCONSISTENCY
	  - X509_V_ERR_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM_MISMATCH
	  - X509_V_ERR_SUBJECT_KEY_IDENTIFIER_CRITICAL
	  - X509_V_ERR_SUBJECT_NAME_EMPTY
	  - X509_V_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM
	- Expose X509_get0_notBefore(), X509_getm_notBefore()
	  X509_get0_nextAfter() and X509_getm_nextAfter() that became
	  available with OpenSSL 1.1.0 and LibreSSL 2.7.0. These, and
	  the deprecated _get functions, are available, as aliases
	  when needed, with all OpenSSL and LibreSSL versions. Fixes
	  GH-367.
	- Only export the TLSv1*_method() functions when support for the respective TLS
	  version is available in the underlying libssl library. This allows
	  Net::SSLeay to be built against libssl libraries that were compiled without
	  support for old TLS versions.

1.92 2022-01-12
	- New stable release incorporating all changes from developer releases 1.91_01
	  to 1.91_03.
	- Summary of major changes since version 1.90:
	  - Net::SSLeay now supports stable releases of OpenSSL 3.0.
	    - OpenSSL 3.0.0 introduces the concept of "providers", which contain
	      cryptographic algorithm implementations. Many outdated, deprecated and/or
	      insecure algorithms have been moved to the "legacy" provider, which may
	      need to be loaded explicitly in order to use them with Net::SSLeay. See
	      "Low level API: OSSL_LIB_CTX and OSSL_PROVIDER related functions" in the
	      Net::SSLeay module documentation for details.
	    - Net::SSLeay's built-in PEM_get_string_PrivateKey() function depends on
	      algorithms that have moved to the legacy provider described above; if
	      OpenSSL has been compiled without the legacy provider, the tests
	      t/local/33_x509_create_cert.t and t/local/63_ec_key_generate_key.t will
	      fail when the test suite is run.
	    - TLS 1.1 and below may only be used at security level 0 as of OpenSSL
	      3.0.0; if a minimum required security level is imposed (e.g. in an
	      OpenSSL configuration file managed by the operating system), the tests
	      t/local/44_sess.t and t/local/45_exporter.t will fail when the test suite
	      is run.
	  - Net::SSLeay now supports stable releases of LibreSSL from the 3.2 - 3.4
	    series (with the exception of 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 - see "COMPATIBILITY" in the
	    Net::SSLeay module documentation for details).
	    - The TLS 1.3 implementation in LibreSSL 3.1 - 3.3, parts of which are
	      enabled by default, is not fully compatible with the libssl API and may
	      not function as expected with Net::SSLeay; see "KNOWN BUGS AND CAVEATS"
	      in the Net::SSLeay module documentation for details.
	  - A number of new libcrypto/libssl constants and functions are now exposed,
	    including SSL_CTX_set_keylog_callback() and SSL_CTX_set_msg_callback(),
	    which are helpful when debugging TLS handshakes. See the release notes for
	    the 1.91 developer releases below for a full list of newly-exposed
	    constants and functions.

1.91_03 2022-01-10
	- Avoid misclassifying Clang as GCC in Test::Net::SSLeay's can_thread()
	  function. This fixes test failures in 61_threads-cb-crash.t and
	  62_threads-ctx_new-deadlock.t on OpenBSD and FreeBSD (and possibly other OSes
	  too). Fixes GH-350.
	- Add the following constants for OpenSSL_version():
	  - OPENSSL_CPU_INFO
	  - OPENSSL_FULL_VERSION_STRING
	  - OPENSSL_MODULES_DIR
	  - OPENSSL_VERSION_STRING
	  These constants are new in OpenSSL 3.0.0 release.
	- Update test 03_use.t to print information returned by the new constants.
	- Add more information to 03_use.t print output, including printing
	  OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER as a 32bit hex number.
	- Add the following constants for OPENSSL_info() added in OpenSSL 3.0.0.
	  - OPENSSL_INFO_CONFIG_DIR
	  - OPENSSL_INFO_CPU_SETTINGS
	  - OPENSSL_INFO_DIR_FILENAME_SEPARATOR
	  - OPENSSL_INFO_DSO_EXTENSION
	  - OPENSSL_INFO_ENGINES_DIR
	  - OPENSSL_INFO_LIST_SEPARATOR
	  - OPENSSL_INFO_MODULES_DIR
	  - OPENSSL_INFO_SEED_SOURCE
	- Expose OPENSSL_info(), OPENSSL_version_major(),
	  OPENSSL_version_minor(), OPENSSL_version_patch(),
	  OPENSSL_version_pre_release() and
	  OPENSSL_version_build_metadata() added in OpenSSL
	  3.0.0. Update 03_use.t diagnostics and 04_basic.t tests to
	  use these functions.
	- Clarify documentation of OpenSSL_version_num(), SSLeay(),
	  SSLeay_version() and OpenSSL_version().
	- Add notes to OpenSSL_version_num() and SSLeay() on how to
	  determine if the library is OpenSSL or LibreSSL and how to
	  interpret the version number these functions return.
	- Add constants OPENSSL_VERSION_MAJOR, OPENSSL_VERSION_MINOR
	  and OPENSSL_VERSION_PATCH. Update
	  OPENSSL_version_major/minor/patch documentation to describe
	  how these library functions relate to Net-SSLeay compile
	  time constants. Add tests to verify the constants and
	  functions return equal values.

1.91_02 2021-12-29
	- On OpenVMS, detect vendor SSL111 product based on OpenSSL 1.1.x.
	- Cast the return value of OCSP_SINGLERESP_get0_id to fix a
	  const/non-const mismatch warning that broke the build on OpenVMS.
	- Create SSL_CTXs with Test::Net::SSLeay's new_ctx() function for tests that
	  are broken with LibreSSL 3.2. Partially fixes GH-232.
	- In 36_verify.t, account for the presence of the X509_V_FLAG_LEGACY_VERIFY
	  flag (signalling the use of the legacy X.509 verifier) in LibreSSL 3.2
	  versions from 3.2.4 onwards. Fixes the remainder of GH-232.
	- Note in the Net::SSLeay documentation that the TLS 1.3 implementation in
	  LibreSSL 3.1 - 3.3, parts of which are enabled by default, is not
	  libssl-compatible. See the "KNOWN BUGS AND CAVEATS" section of
	  lib/Net/SSLeay.pod for details.
	- Add constants for, but not limited to,
	  SSL_CTX_set_msg_callback and SSL_set_msg_callback functions:
	  SSL3_RT_* for record content types, SSL3_MT_* for Handshake
	  and ChangeCipherSpec message types, SSL2_VERSION to
	  complement the list of existing SSL and TLS version
	  constants and SSL2_MT_* for SSLv2 Handshake messages.
	- Expose SSL_CTX_set_keylog_callback and
	  SSL_CTX_get_keylog_callback available with OpenSSL 1.1.1pre1
	  and later.
	- Enhance 10_rand.t RAND_file_name tests: tests are no longer
	  affected by the runtime environment variables, HOME and
	  RANDFILE. These variables are insted controlled by the tests
	  with local %ENV. Problems related to RAND_file_name were
	  discussed in Github issue GH-152, and there might still be
	  cases when, for example, setuid is used because of OpenSSL's
	  use of glibc secure_getenv() and related functions. Address
	  RAND_file_name differences between OpenSSL versions. Note in
	  SSLeay.pod that RAND_file_name() can return undef with
	  LibreSSL and recent OpenSSL versions.
	- Removed the following exportable symbols from SSLeay.pm:
	  - SESSION, clear_error and err have never been defined.
	  - add_session, flush_sessions and remove_session were
	    removed in Net::SSLeay 1.04
	  - Undocumented X509_STORE_CTX_set_flags() was removed in
	    Net::SSLeay 1.37 when X509_VERIFY_PARAM_* functions were
	    added. These are preferred over directly setting the flags.
	- Clarified Changes entry for release 1.75 to state that
	  CTX_v2_new is not removed from Net::SSLeay. SSLv2 is
	  completely removed in OpenSSL 1.1.0.
	- Beginning with OpenSSL 3.0.0-alpha17, SSL_CTX_get_options()
	  and related functions return uint64_t instead of long. For
	  this reason constant() in constant.c and Net::SSLeay must
	  also be able to return 64bit constants. Add uint64_t
	  definitions to typemap file and update constant() and
	  options functions to use uint64_t with OpenSSL 3.0.0 and
	  later when Perl is compiled with 64bit integers. With 32bit
	  integers, the functions remain as they are: constant()
	  functions return double and options functions return
	  long. This partially fixes GH-315, 32bit integer Perls need
	  to be handled separately.
	- Work around macOS Monterey build failure during 'perl
	  Makefile.PL' that causes perl to exit with 'WARNING:
	  .../perl is loading libcrypto in an unsafe way' or similar
	  message. This fixes GH-329. Thanks to Daniel J. Luke for the
	  report and John Napiorkowski for additional help.

1.91_01 2021-10-24
	- Correct X509_STORE_CTX_init() return value to integer. Previous
	  versions of Net::SSLeay return nothing.
	- Update tests to call close() to avoid problems seen with
	  test 44_sess.t, and possibly other tests, running on older
	  Windows Perl versions. Also add some missing calls in tests
	  to shutdown and free ssl structures.
	- Fix multiple formatting errors in the documentation for Net::SSLeay.
	  Thanks to John Jetmore.
	- Check for presence of libssl headers in Makefile.PL, and exit with an
	  error instead of generating an invalid Makefile if they cannot be found.
	  Fixes RT#105189. Thanks to James E Keenan for the report.
	- Added support for SSL_CTX_set_msg_callback/SSL_set_msg_callback
	  Thanks to Tim Aerts.
	- Adjust time in ASN1_TIME_timet based on current offset to GMT to
	  address GH-148. Thanks to Steffen Ullrich.
	- Multiple updates to tests to match OpenSSL 3.0 behaviour.
	  Thanks to Michal Josef Špaček.
	- OpenSSL 3.0 related changes in tests include:
	  - TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 require security level 0 starting with 3.0 alpha 5.
	  - SSL_CTX_set_ciphersuites() and SSL_set_ciphersuites() ignore
	    unknown ciphersuites starting with 3.0 alpha 11.
	  - Error code and error string packing and formatting changes.
	  - PEM_get_string_PrivateKey default algorithm requires legacy provider.
	- See OpenSSL manual page migration_guide(7) for more information about
	  changes in OpenSSL 3.0.
	- Automatically detect OpenSSL installed via Homebrew on ARM-based macOS
	  systems. Thanks to Graham Knop for the patch.
	- Account for the divergence in TLSv1.3 ciphersuite names between OpenSSL and
	  LibreSSL, which was causing failures of some TLSv1.3 tests with LibreSSL.
	- In 36_verify.t, account for the presence of the X509_V_FLAG_LEGACY_VERIFY
	  flag (signalling the use of the legacy X.509 verifier) in LibreSSL 3.3.2 and
	  above.
	- In 43_misc_functions.t, account for the fact that LibreSSL 3.2.0 and above
	  implement TLSv1.3 without exposing a TLS1_3_VERSION constant.
	- Expose OpenSSL 3.0 functions
	  OSSL_LIB_CTX_get0_global_default, OSSL_PROVIDER_load,
	  OSSL_PROVIDER_try_load, OSSL_PROVIDER_unload,
	  OSSL_PROVIDER_available, OSSL_PROVIDER_do_all
	  OSSL_PROVIDER_get0_name and OSSL_PROVIDER_self_test.
	  Add test files 22_provider.t, 22_provider_try_load.t and
	  22_provider_try_load_zero_retain.t.
	- With OpenSSL 3.0 and later, the legacy provider is loaded in
	  33_x509_create_cert.t to allow PEM_get_string_PrivateKey to
	  continue working until its default encryption method is
	  updated. Fixes GH-272 and closes GH-273.
	- Remove the test suite's optional dependency on the non-core modules
	  Test::Exception, Test::NoWarnings and Test::Warn. Tests that verify
	  Net::SSLeay's behaviour when errors occur are now executed regardless of the
	  availability of these modules.
	- Fully automate the process of changing the list of constants exported by
	  Net::SSLeay. Fixes GH-313.
	- Perform function autoloading tests in the test suite. Fixes GH-311.
	- In 36_verify.t, account for the fact that the X509_V_FLAG_LEGACY_VERIFY flag
	  (signalling the use of the legacy X.509 verifier) is no longer exposed as of
	  LibreSSL 3.4.1. Fixes GH-324.

1.90 2021-01-21
	- New stable release incorporating all changes from developer releases
	  1.89_01 to 1.89_05.
	- Summary of major changes since version 1.88:
	  - Formalised libssl version support policy: all stable versions of OpenSSL
	    in the 0.9.8 - 1.1.1 branches (with the exception of 0.9.8 - 0.9.8b) and
	    all stable releases of LibreSSL in the 2.0 - 3.1 series are supported.
	    The LibreSSL 3.2 series is not yet fully supported because its TLSv1.3
	    implementation is not currently libssl-compatible.
	  - Added support for LibreSSL on Windows when built with Visual C++.
	  - Exposed P_X509_CRL_add_extensions, several SSL_CIPHER functions, and
	    several stack functions.
	  - Fixed crashes in the callback functions CTX_set_next_proto_select_cb and
	    CTX_set_alpn_select_cb.
	  - The test suite is now compatible with OpenSSL 1.1.1e onwards, as well as
	    OpenSSL security level 2 (the default on many Linux distributions).

1.89_05 2021-01-21
	- Expose SSL_get_ciphers. Thanks to github user dylc5190.
	- Expose SSL_CIPHER_get_version and fix SSL_CIPHER_description
	  and SSL_CIPHER_get_bits. Also fixed and enhanced
	  documentation for these and related SSL_CIPHER functions.
	- Clarify libssl version support policy: all stable versions of OpenSSL in
	  the 0.9.8 - 1.1.1 branches (with the exception of 0.9.8 - 0.9.8b) and all
	  stable releases of LibreSSL in the 2.0 - 3.1 series are supported.
	- Direct bug reports to the GitHub repository, since rt.cpan.org will shut
	  down on 2021-03-01.

1.89_04 2021-01-13
	- Fix crashes in the callback functions CTX_set_next_proto_select_cb() and
	  CTX_set_alpn_select_cb() caused by the use of a pointer returned by
	  SSL_select_next_proto() which may already have been freed under certain
	  circumstances. Fixes GH-222. Thanks to dylc5190 for the report.
	- Remove the dependency on the AES128-SHA cipher suite in the test script
	  64_ticket_sharing.t. Fixes GH-231.
	- Remove checks and warnings in Makefile.PL relating to the use of RSAref,
	  which was removed from OpenSSL in version 0.9.7.

1.89_03 2020-12-12
	- Expose the following functions:
	  - X509_STORE_CTX_get0_cert, X509_STORE_CTX_get1_chain
	  - sk_X509_pop, sk_X509_shift, sk_X509_unshift,
	  - sk_X509_insert, sk_X509_delete, sk_x509_value, sk_X509_num
	  Thanks to Dan Freed.
	- Correct the minimum OpenSSL version required for the following functions
	  to be made available (previously they were all declared to be present in
	  1.1.0-pre1, which caused Net::SSLeay to crash at run-time when built
	  against OpenSSL versions between 1.1.0-pre1 and 1.1.0-pre3):
	  - CTX_set_max_proto_version (added in 1.1.0-pre2)
	  - CTX_set_min_proto_version (added in 1.1.0-pre2)
	  - SESSION_up_ref (added in 1.1.0-pre4)
	  - set_max_proto_version (added in 1.1.0-pre2)
	  - set_min_proto_version (added in 1.1.0-pre2)
	- Correct the minimum OpenSSL version required for get_SSL_CTX and SSL_ctrl
	  to be made available (previously they were declared to be present from
	  0.9.8f onwards, when in reality they are available in all 0.9.8 versions).
	- Replace the PKI used by the test suite with one generated by the
	  generate-test-pki helper script. All entities in the new PKI have 2048-bit
	  RSA private keys and CSRs, certificates and CRLs with SHA-256 digests,
	  allowing the test suite to execute under OpenSSL security level 2 (now the
	  default security level for OpenSSL in many Linux distributions).
	- Initialise libssl consistently in the test suite.
	- Don't rely on the availability of specific SSL/TLS protocol versions or
	  cipher suites in the test suite; instead, dynamically select from any of
	  the available protocol versions and cipher suites permitted by libssl.
	  Fixes RT#132425. Thanks to Graham Ollis for the initial report of the test
	  suite failing on Ubuntu 20.04 with the Ubuntu-packaged OpenSSL, whose
	  configuration forbids the use of TLSv1.1 and below at run-time by default.

1.89_02 2020-08-07
	- Add support for the P_X509_CRL_add_extensions function. Thanks to
	  Manuel Mausz for the patch.
	- X509_get_subjectAltNames now knows how to return
	  GEN_RID. The returned value is an ASN OID in text format
	  with current maximum length of 2500 characters. Updated
	  t/local/33_x509_create_cert.t to use GEN_RID and all other
	  supported types with certificate request and signed
	  certificate. These relate to GitHub issue GH-149 opened by
	  s482dcaw.
	- Support for 64-bit Windows versions of OpenSSL from 1.0.0-beta1
	  through to 1.0.0b has been withdrawn due to malfunctions occurring in
	  Perl programs that use fork(). This mainly affects users of Strawberry
	  Perl x64 5.12.3.20180709, which ships with OpenSSL 1.0.0-beta4.
	  Affected users should build Net-SSLeay against OpenSSL 1.0.0c or
	  above; users of Strawberry Perl x64 5.12.3.20180709 may instead find
	  it easier to upgrade to Strawberry Perl x64 5.14.4.1 or above. See
	  https://github.com/radiator-software/p5-net-ssleay/issues/189 for more
	  information.

1.89_01 2020-03-22
	- Fix the repository URL in Makefile.PL (git:// rather than git@),
	  which was preventing it from being added to META.json. Thanks to
	  Dan Book.
	- When building Net-SSLeay, exit if an OpenSSL executable cannot be
	  found in PATH. Fixes RT#131060. Thanks to Nigel Horne for the report.
	- Remove non-OCSP external tests, many of which unnecessarily duplicate
	  local tests or fail for reasons outside of our control. Fixes
	  RT#129542. Thanks to Andreas Vögele for the bug report that
	  ultimately led to this change.
	- Add support for LibreSSL on Windows when built with Visual C++.
	  Thanks to Graham Ollis for the patch.
	- In SSL_CTX_free() and SSL_free(), clean callback-related data from
	  the global hash after freeing ctx, not before. This allows callbacks
	  to be executed during freeing. Thanks to Steffen Ullrich for the
	  patch.
	- t/local/07_sslecho.t started failing with OpenSSL 1.1.1e. Updated
	  the test file with missing calls to Net::SSLeay::shutdown(). Also
	  added one call in SSLeay.pm sslcat() function. Enabling SSLeay trace
	  level 3 showed 'unexpected eof while reading' errors which were added
	  to OpenSSL with commit db943f43. This fixes GitHub issue GH-160
	  reported by Brett T. Warden.
	- t/local/01_pod.t now requires Test::Pod 1.41 to work with Pod syntax
	  used with Net::SSLeay 1.88 and later. This fixes GitHub issue GH-147
	  reported by Ulrik Haugen.

1.88 2019-05-10
	- New stable release incorporating all changes from developer
	  releases 1.86_01 to 1.86_11.
	- From this release, Net-SSLeay is switching to an "odd/even"
	  developer/stable release version numbering system, like that of
	  many core modules (e.g. ExtUtils::MakeMaker): developer releases
	  will have an odd minor version number (and the usual "_xx" suffix),
	  and stable releases will have an even minor version number. This
	  means there is no Net-SSLeay 1.87.
	- Summary of major changes since version 1.85:
	  - Mike McCauley has stepped down as maintainer. The new maintainers
	    are Chris Novakovic, Heikki Vatiainen and Tuure Vartiainen.
	  - The source code has moved from the now-defunct Debian Subversion
	    server (alioth.debian.org) to GitHub
	    (https://github.com/radiator-software/p5-net-ssleay).
	  - Net-SSLeay is provided under the terms of the Artistic License
	    2.0 - this has been the case since version 1.66, but references
	    to other licenses remained in the source code, causing ambiguity.
	  - Perl 5.8.1 or newer is now required to use Net-SSLeay. This has
	    already been the case for some time in practice, as the test
	    suite hasn't fully passed on Perl 5.6 for several years.
	  - Much-improved compatibility with OpenSSL 1.1.1, and improved
	    support for TLS 1.3.
	  - Fixed a long-standing bug in cb_data_advanced_put() that caused
	    memory leaks when callbacks were frequently added and removed.
	  - Support in the test suite for "hardened" OpenSSL configurations
	    that set a default security level of 2 or higher (e.g., in the
	    OpenSSL packages that ship with recent versions of Debian, Fedora
	    and Ubuntu).

1.86_11 2019-05-08
	- Clarified Net-SSLeay's licensing terms: the module distribution has
	  been released under the terms of the Artistic License 2.0 since
	  version 1.66; references to other licenses have been removed. Fixes
	  RT#106314. Thanks to Kent Fredric for pointing out the ambiguity.
	- Replace the HTTPS hosts in the external tests (some of which were
	  no longer online) with more resilient ones. Closes issue #26.

1.86_10 2019-05-04
	- Use locally-generated certificate chain in local tests rather
	  than the Twitter one, which changes regularly and breaks the
	  test suite unnecessarily. Fixes RT#129201. Thanks to Petr Písař
	  for the report and patch, and Steffen Ullrich for an alternative
	  patch suggestion.
	- In t/local/09_ctx_new.t, rather than checking that the functions
	  (CTX_)get_min_proto_version and (CTX_)get_max_proto_version return
	  0x0000 (indicating the lowest and highest versions supported by
	  libssl respectively, which is not the case if a run-time
	  configuration is enforcing a different minimum or maximum), just
	  check whether the returned value is one of those mentioned on the
	  SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version(3) man page. Partially fixes
	  RT#128025. Thanks to Slaven Rezić and Dmytro Zagashev for the
	  downstream reports.
	- Move from 1024-bit keys/certificates to 2048-bit keys/certificates
	  across the entire test suite. This removes the need to manually
	  set the security level to 1 in tests that used the old keys, and
	  fixes large numbers of test failures on modern Linux distributions
	  that set the minimum OpenSSL security level to 2. Fixes RT#126270
	  and the remainder of RT#128025. Thanks to Petr Písař and Slaven
	  Rezić for the downstream reports.
	- In t/local/06_tcpecho.t and t/local/07_sslecho.t, connect to
	  127.0.0.1 instead of localhost. This fixes these tests when
	  executed inside a network sandbox that disrupts the behaviour of
	  gethostbyname(). Fixes RT#128207. Thanks to Kent Fredric for the
	  downstream report.

1.86_09 2019-03-12
	- Add missing files to MANIFEST that prevented tests from passing
	  when installing from the 1.86_08 release tarball.

1.86_08 2019-03-12
	- Add and fix functions needed to properly implement client
	  side session reuse for TLS 1.3 with using
	  CTX_sess_set_new_cb. Newly exposed functions:
	  SSL_SESSION_dup and SSL_SESSION_up_ref.
	  Fixed functions: i2d_SSL_SESSION and d2i_SSL_SESSION.
	  Thanks to Steffen Ullrich.
	- Add functions functions to allow reading multiple pems from
	  file and creating untrusted chain: These functions allow you
	  to:
	  - Read in a PEM file with multiple certificates as a
	    STACK_OF(X509_INFO)
	  - Determine the size of the STACK_OF(X509_INFO) and value at
	    an index, which allows you to loop over the stack.
	  - Retrieve the X509 structure from each X509_INFO structure
	    in the stack.
	  Then you can create a new STACK_OF(X509) and push the X509
	  structures onto the new stack. You can then pass this
	  STACK_OF(X509) to X509_STORE_CTX_init which will allow you
	  to add additional untrusted certificates to the chain for
	  verification. Exposed functions are:
	  PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio
	  sk_X509_INFO_num
	  sk_X509_INFO_value
	  sk_X509_INFO_free
	  sk_X509_new_null
	  sk_X509_free
	  sk_X509_push
	  New function implemented by Net::SSLeay:
	  P_X509_INFO_get_x509
	  Thanks to Marc Reisner.
	- Add functions and constants that are necessary to verify a
	  certificate using a hash directory outside of an SSL/TLS
	  connection. Newly exposed functions:
	  X509_STORE_CTX_init
	  X509_STORE_CTX_free
	  X509_STORE_new
	  X509_STORE_free
	  X509_STORE_add_lookup
	  X509_LOOKUP_hash_dir
	  X509_LOOKUP_add_dir
	  Newly exposed constants:
	  X509_FILETYPE_ASN1
	  X509_FILETYPE_DEFAULT
	  X509_FILETYPE_PEM
	  Thanks to Marc Reisner.
	- Declare n_a in ssleay_set_psk_client_callback_invoke and
	  ssleay_ctx_set_psk_client_callback_invoke to avoid a compilation
	  error with Perl versions below 5.8.8. Fixes RT#128030. Thanks to
	  Graham Ollis for the report.
	- Add X509_get0_serialNumber. Thanks to Marc Reisner.
	- Enable Travis CI for LibreSSL 2.2.1, 2.7.5, 2.8.3 and 2.9.0
	  on Perl 5.20 and more recent.
	- Expose the following functions for curve and group selection:
	  - CTX_set_ecdh_auto, set_ecdh_auto
	  - CTX_set1_curves_list, set1_curves_list
	  - CTX_set1_groups_list, set1_groups_list
	  Thanks to Steffen Ullrich.

1.86_07 2018-12-13
        - Net::SSLeay::RSA_generate_key() now prefers using
          RSA_generate_key_ex. This avois deprecated RSA_generate_key
          and allows removing the only Android specific code in
          SSLeay.xs. Fixes RT#127593. Thanks to Rouven Weiler.
	- SSL_CTX_get0_param, SSL_CTX_get0_param,
	  X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host, X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add1_host,
	  X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_hostflags,
	  X509_VERIFY_PARAM_get0_peername,
	  X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_email, X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_ip and
	  X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_ip_asc added in 1.83 for OpenSSL
	  1.0.2 and later are now available with LibreSSL 2.7.0 and
	  later.
	- get_keyblock_size() now gets the MAC secret size from the
	  cipher on LibreSSL 2.7.0 and later, rather than reaching
	  into libssl internals. This effectively takes the OpenSSL
	  1.1 code path for LibreSSL 2.7.0 instead of the OpenSSL 1.0
	  code path.  Thanks to Alexander Bluhm.
	- get_client_random and get_server_random now use API
	  functions supported by LibreSSL 2.7.0 and later. Thanks to
	  Alexander Bluhm.
	- Add X509_check_host(), X509_check_email(), X509_check_ip(),
	  and X509_check_ip_asc() for LibreSSL 2.5.0 and later. Thanks
	  to Alexander Bluhm.
        - OpenSSL_version() and OpenSSL_version_num() are available
          with LibreSSL 2.7.0 and later. Thanks to Alexander Bluhm.
        - Use OPENSSL_cleanse() instead of memset(). Fixes
          RT#116599. Thanks to A. Sinan Unur.

1.86_06 2018-09-29
	- Net::SSLeay::read() and SSL_peek() now check SSL_get_error()
	  for SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN for return values <= 0 to make
	  Net::SSLeay::read() behave more like underlying OpenSSL
	  function SSL_read().
	  Convenience function ssl_read_all() now does an automatic
	  retry when ERROR_WANT_READ or ERROR_WANT_WRITE is returned
	  with Net::SSLeay::read().
	  Convenience function ssl_read_until() now uses
	  Net::SSLeay::ssl_read_all() instead of
	  Net::SSLeay::read(). Tests 07_sslecho.t and 36_verify.t were
	  also updated to use ssl_read_all() and ssl_write_all(). The
	  tests now also disable TLSv1.3 session tickets and ignore
	  SIGPIPE to avoid this signal when the client has finished
	  before server has sent session tickets and called
	  Net::SSLeay::accept().
	  Thanks to Petr Pisar and Sebastian Andrzej Siewior for the
	  patches (in #RT125218).
	- Fix a memory leak in cb_data_advanced_put. Fixes
	  RT#127131. Noticed, investigated and patched by Paul
	  Evans. Thanks!
	- Enable OpenSSL 1.1.1-pre9 with Travis CI.
	- Add SSL_CTX_set_num_tickets, SSL_CTX_get_num_tickets,
	  SSL_set_num_ticket and SSL_get_num_tickets for controlling
	  the number of TLSv1.3 session tickets that are issued.  Add
	  tests in 44_sess.t. Parts taken from a larger patch by Petr
	  Pisar of RedHat.
	- Add SSL_CTX_set_ciphersuites and SSL_set_ciphersuites for
	  configuring the available TLSv1.3 ciphersuites. Add tests in
	  43_misc_functions.t and clarify SSL_client_version tests.
	- Add SSL_CTX_set_security_level, SSL_CTX_get_security_level,
	  SSL_set_security_level and SSL_get_security_level.
	  Add new test file 65_security_level.t.
	  All courtesy of Damyan Ivanov of Debian project.
	- Fix export_keying_material return value check and context
	  handling. SSL_export_keying_material use_context is now
	  correctly set to non-zero value when context is an empty
	  string. This affects values exported with TLSv1.2 and earlier.
	  Update documentation in NetSSLeay.pod and add tests
	  in t/local/45_export.t.
	- Add RAND_priv_bytes. Add new test file t/local/10_rand.t for
	  RAND_bytes, RAND_pseudo_bytes, RAND_priv_bytes, RAND_status,
	  RAND_poll, RAND_file_name and RAND_load_file.
	- Update documentation for RAND_*bytes return values and
	  RAND_file_name behaviour with LibreSSL.
	- Add SSL_SESSION_is_resumable. Add and update tests in 44_sess.t.
	- Set OpenSSL security level to 1 in tests that use the test suite's
	  (1024-bit) RSA keys, which allows the test suite to pass when
	  Net-SSLeay is built against an OpenSSL with a higher default
	  security level. Fixes RT#126987. Thanks to Petr Pisar (in
	  RT#126270) and Damyan Ivanov (in RT#126987) for the reports and
	  patches, and to Damyan Ivanov for the preferred patch.
	- Add SSL_CTX_sess_set_new_cb and SSL_CTX_sess_set_remove_cb.
	  Add new test file 44_sess.t for these and future session
	  related tests for which no specific test file is needed.
	- Add SSL_get_version, SSL_client_version and SSL_is_dtls.
	- Add SSL_peek_ex, SSL_read_ex, SSL_write_ex and SSL_has_pending.
	  Add tests in t/local/11_read.t
	- Add SSL_CTX_set_post_handshake_auth contributed by Paul
	  Howarth. Add SSL_set_post_handshake_auth,
	  SSL_verify_client_post_handshake and constant
	  SSL_VERIFY_POST_HANDSHAKE.
	- Applied a patch to set_cert_and_key() from Damyan Ivanov,
	  Debian Perl Group. This function now returns errors from
	  library's error stack only when an underlying routine
	  fails. Unrelated errors are now skipped. Fixes RT#126988.
	- Add support for TLSv1.3 via $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version.
	- Enhance t/local/43_misc_functions.t get_keyblock_size test
	  to work better with AEAD ciphers.
	- Add constants SSL_OP_ENABLE_MIDDLEBOX_COMPAT and
	  SSL_OP_NO_ANTI_REPLAY for TLSv1.3
	- Fix compile time DEFINE=-DSHOW_XS_DEBUG to work with
	  non-threaded Perls. Fixes RT#127027. Thanks to SREZIC for
	  the report. Also fix other minor compile warnings.

1.86_05 2018-08-22
	- Net-SSLeay now requires at least Perl 5.8.1. This is a
	  formalisation of what has been the de facto case for some time,
	  as the distribution hasn't compiled and passed its tests on Perl
	  5.005 for several years.
	- Increment Net::SSLeay::Handle's version number to keep it in sync
	  with Net::SSLeay's, thus satisfying Kwalitee's consistent_version
	  metric.
	- Re-enable the d2i_X509_bio() test in t/local/33_x509_create_cert.t
	  for LibreSSL. Thanks to Alexander Bluhm.
	- Automatically detect new library names on Windows for OpenSSL
	  1.1.0 onwards (libcrypto, libssl). Fixes part of RT#121084. Thanks
	  to Jean-Damien Durand.
	- Fix a typo preventing OpenSSL libraries built with the VC compiler
	  (i.e. ones with a ".lib" suffix) from being automatically detected
	  on Windows. Fixes part of RT#121084. Thanks to Jean-Damien Durand.
	- Add missing call to va_end() following va_start() in TRACE().
	  Fixes RT#126028. Thanks to Jitka Plesnikova.
	- Added SSL_in_init() and the related functions for all
	  libraries and their versions. All return 0 or 1 as
	  documented by OpenSSL 1.1.1. Use of these functions is
	  recommended over using constants returned by get_state() and
	  state(). New constants TLS_ST_*, used by OpenSSL 1.1.0 and
	  later, will not be made available by Net::SSLeay.

1.86_04 2018-07-30
	- Re-add SSLv3_method() for OpenSSL 1.0.2 and above. Fixes
	  RT#101484.
	- Don't expose ENGINE-related functions when building against
	  OpenSSL builds without ENGINE support. Fixes RT#121538. Thanks to
	  Paul Green.
	- Automatically detect OpenSSL 1.0.x on VMS, and update VMS
	  installation instructions to reflect removal of Module::Install
	  from the build system. Fixes RT#124388. Thanks to Craig A. Berry.
	- Prevent memory leak in OCSP_cert2ids() and OCSP_response_verify().
	  Fixes RT#125273. Thanks to Steffen Ullrich.

1.86_03 2018-07-19
	- Convert packaging to ExtUtils::MakeMaker. Thanks to mohawk2.
	- Module::Install is no longer a prerequisite when building
	  from the reposistory.
	- Re-apply patch from ETJ permitting configure and build in
	  places with a space in the name.

1.86_02 2018-07-06
	- Removed inc/ from repository. Module::Install is now a
	  prerequisite when building from the repository. This allowed
	  also removing "." from Makefile.PL lib path which was added
	  in version 1.81. These updates require no changes when
	  building from release packages. They also help AppVeyor
	  builds to work better with old Perls.

	- Added CONTRIBUTING.md, reformatted the previous Changes
          entry to use CPAN::Changes::Spec guidelines and removed
          unused version control tags from comments.

1.86_01 2018-07-04
	- Net::SSLeay functionality was not changed in this release.

	- Maintainer changes:
	  - Mike McCauley, maintainer of Net-SSLeay since November 2005,
	    has stepped down. Thanks to Mike for his 13 years of
	    stewardship.
	  - Net-SSLeay is now maintained by Chris Novakovic, Heikki
	    Vatiainen and Tuure Vartiainen.

	- Version control system changes:
	  - The previous Debian-hosted SVN repository has been imported
	    into Git. The source code is now maintained on GitHub, at
	    https://github.com/radiator-software/p5-net-ssleay.

	  - Fixes to commit metadata, branches and tags that git-svn
	    couldn't handle or had no way of handling, were done
	    manually or semi-automatically afterwards. For instance, the
	    "git-svn-id:" lines that git-svn appends to commit messages
	    were kept because Mike used SVN revision numbers in RT
	    replies to indicate when bugs had been fixed/patches applied
	    (which may be useful for future reference).

	  - All commits were replayed onto a single master branch rather
	    than having separate dead-end branches for the old SVN
	    version tags (as this seems more "git-like").

	  - New lightweight tags were created for each public release
	    going back as far as the start of the SVN repository using
	    data from MetaCPAN (cross-referencing with the changelog
	    when it wasn't clear when a release was cut from the SVN
	    repo).

	  - Florian's and Mike's email addresses were mapped to git
	    author/committer IDs

	- Continuous integration:
	  - Travis CI configuration was added for automated testing on
	    Linux using 64 bit Ubuntu Trusty. Build matrix dimensions
	    are: Perl 5.8 - 5.26 x OpenSSL 0.9.8zh - 1.1.0h. Only the
	    currently latest version for each major Perl and OpenSSL
	    release is chosen.

	  - AppVeyor configuration was added for automated testing on
	    Windows. Build matrix dimensions are: Perl 5.8 - 5.26 x
	    32bit and 64bit Perl environment x Windows Server 2012R2 and
	    Windows Server 2016. The Perl environment is Strawberry Perl
	    and its OpenSSL is used with builds. Only the latest major
	    versions are used, similarly to Travis CI. Net-SSLeay PPM
	    and PPD files are made available as artifacts.

	  - Added README.md with link to master branch build and test
	    status. Did minor updates to README and other misc files.

	- Release packaging:
	  - Files t/local/43_misc_functions.t and
	    t/local/65_ticket_sharing_2.t were missing from MANIFEST.

	  - Updated inc/ directory with Module::Install 1.19. Updated
	    Makefile.PL author and resource information. Synced
	    SSLeay.pm under ext/ with the latest changes under
	    inc/. Reordered use imports so that META.yml gets correctly
	    regenerated. More Module::Install related changes will
	    follow.

 	- The same callback is used on a server side for OCSP stapling and in that 
  	 case ocsp_response is NULL and not used.
	 - New feature: Added a binding SSL_set_session_ticket_ext_cb(ssl,callback,data)
	 - A callback used by EAP-FAST/EAP-TEAT to parse and process TLS session ticket.
	 - Tests are in t/local/65_ticket_sharing_2.t

	 - Bugfix: tlsext_ticket_key_cb_invoke(...): allow SHA256 HMAC key to be 32 bytes 
	 instead of 16 bytes (which OpenSSL will pad with zeros up to 32 bytes).
	 - New feature: Added following bindings:
	 - X509_get_ex_data(cert,idx)
	 - X509_get_ex_new_index(argl,argp,new_func,dup_funL,free_func)

	against has compression support compiled out. From Stephan
	Wall. Thanks.
	Added RSA_get_key_parameters() to return a list of pointers to RSA key
	internals.
	Patch to fix some documentation typos courtesy gregor herrmann.
	RSA_get_key_parameters() is now only available prior OpenSSL 1.1.
	Testing with openssl-1.1.0b.

1.78	 2016-08-13
	 Fixed broken OCSP code and tests. Broken since 1.75. Patched by
	 Steffen Ullrich. Thanks.

1.77	 2016-08-01
	 Fixed incorrect size to memset in tlsext_ticket_key_cb_invoke.

1.76	 2016-07-31
	 Replaced bzero with memset. Bzero not present on windows.

1.75  2016-07-31
     Compatibility with OpenSSL 1.1, tested with openssl-1.1.0-pre5:
     - Conditionally remove threading locking code, not needed in 1.1
     - Rewrite code that accesses inside X509_ATTRIBUTE struct.
     - SSL_CTX_need_tmp_RSA, SSL_CTX_set_tmp_rsa,
       SSL_CTX_set_tmp_rsa_callback, SSL_set_tmp_rsa_callback support
       not available in 1.1.
     - SSL_session_reused is now native
     - SSL_get_keyblock_size modifed to use new API
     - OCSP functions modified to use new API under 1.1
     - SSL_set_state removed with 1.1
     - SSL_get_state and SSL_state are now equivalent and available in all
       versions
     - SSL_CTX_v2_new is not available with 1.1 and later. SSLv2 is removed in 1.1.
     - SESSION_set_master_key removed with 1.1. Code that previously used
       SESSION_set_master_key must now set $secret in the session_secret
       callback set with SSL_set_session_secret_cb
     - With 1.1, $secret in the session_secret
       callback set with SSL_set_session_secret_cb can be changed to alter
       the master key (required by EAP-FAST).
     Added a function EC_KEY_generate_key similar to RSA_generate_key and a
     function EVP_PKEY_assign_EC_KEY similar to EVP_PKEY_assign_RSA. Using
     these functions it is easy to create and use EC keys in the same way as
     RSA keys. Patch provided by Steffen Ullrich. Thanks Steffen.
     Testing with LibreSSL 2.4.1, with compatibility patch from Steffen
     Ullrich. Thanks Steffen.
     Patch from Steffen Ulrich provides  support for cross context (and cross process)
     session sharing using the stateless TLS session tickets. It uses the
     SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_ticket_key_cb function to manage the encryption and
     decryption of the tickets but provides a more simplified
     interface. Includes new function CTX_set_tlsext_ticket_getkey_cb.
     To not conflict with the OpenSSL name in case the more complex interface
     will be implemented ever the current simplified interface is called
     slightly different: CTX_set_tlsext_ticket_*get*key_cb. 
     Added documentation about downloading latest version from SVN.
     Added missing Module/install files to SVN.

1.74 2016-04-12

     latest version of  OSX homebrew openssl. Patch from Shoichi Kaji.

1.72 2015-09-22
     Fixed a problem where SvPVx_nolen was undefined in some versions of
     perl. Reported by Karen Etheridge. Replaced with SvPV_nolen.
     Fixed a cast warning on Darwin reported by Karen Etheridge. 

1.71 2015-09-18
     Patch from Ben Kaduk: Conditionalise support for MD4, MD5.
     Added support for linking libraries in /usr/local/lib64 for some flavours
     of Linux like RH Tikanga. 
     Fixes to X509_check_host, X509_check_ip, SSL_CTX_set_alpn_protos, and
     SSL_set_alpn_protos so they will compile on MSVC and AIX cc. Thanks to
     AGRUNDMA.
     Fixed typos in documentation for X509_NAME_new and X509_NAME_hash
     incorrect version 1.45 instead of 1.55 given.
     Version number in META.yml is now quoted per request from Satoshi Yagi.
     

1.70 2015-06-26
     Patch from Alexander Bluhm: The new OpenSSL 1.0.2 X509_check_* functions are not available in
     current LibreSSL.  So disable them in SSLeay.xs.
     Fixed a problem with building against OSX homebrew's openssl. Patch from
     Shoichi Kaji.
     Removed a test in t/local/33_x509_create_cert.t which fails due to
     changes in 1.0.1n and later

1.69 2015-06-04
     Testing with OpenSSL 1.0.2, 1.0.2a. OK.
     Completed LibreSSL compatibility with the kind assistance of Alexander
     Bluhm.
     Improved compatibility with OpenSSL 1.0.2a as suggested by Petr Pisar.
     Added the X509_check_* functions introduced in OpenSSL 1.0.2, contributed
     by Carsten Gaebler.

     Patch allows get_keyblock_size to work correctly with 
     OpenSSL 1.0.1 and later versions. Contributed by Heikki Vatiainen.

1.68 2015-01-24
     Fixed a problem on OSX when macports openssl 1.x is installed: headers from
     macport were found but older OSX openssl libraries were linked, resulting
     in "Symbol not found: _EVP_MD_do_all_sorted".
     Added notes about runtime error "no OPENSSL_Applink", when calling
     Net::SSLeay::P_PKCS12_load_file.


1.67 2015-01-17
     Improvements to inc/Module/Install/PRIVATE/Net/SSLeay.pm to handle the
     case whe there are muliple OPENSSLs installed. Patch from HBRAND
     Fixed a documentation error in get_peer_cert_chain, reported by tejas.
     Fixed a problem with building on Windows that prevented correct OpenSSL
     directory detection with version 1.0.1j as delivered with Shining Light OpenSSL.
     Fixed a problem with building on Windows that prevented finding MT or MD
     versions of SSL libraries.
     Updated doc in README.Win32 to build with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express.
     Added Windows crypt32 library to Windows linking as some compilers/platforms seem to
     require it and it is innocuous otherwise. For Steve Hay.
     Fixed a failure in t/external/20_cert_chain.t where some platforms do not
     have HTTPS in /etc/services. Reported and patched by Gisle Aas.
     Recent 1.0.2 betas have dropped the SSLv3_method function. 
     This patch leaves out the function on newer versions, much the same as
     the SSLv2 deprecation is handled. Patch from Tom Molesworth.
     Fix the ALPN test, which was incorrectly failing on OpenSSL due to the
     LibreSSL check (earlier versions bailed out before that line).Patch from
     Tom Molesworth. 

1.66 2014-08-21
     Fixed compile problem with perl prior to 5.8.8, similar to
     RT#76267. Reported by Graham Knop.
     Fixed a problem with Socket::IPPROTO_TCP on early perls.
     After discussions with the community and the original author Sampo
     Kellomaki, the license conditions have been changed to "Perl Artisitic
     License 2.0".


1.65  2014-07-14
     Added note to doc to make it clear that X509_get_subjectAltNames returns a
     packed binary IP address for type 7 - GEN_IPADD.
     Improvements to SSL_OCSP_response_verify to compile under non c99
     compilers. Requested by MERIJNB.
     Port to Android, contributed by Brian Fraser. Includes Android specific
     version of RSA_generate_key.
     Added LibreSSL support, patch provided by Alexander Bluhm. Thanks!
     Patch that fixes the support for SSL_set_info_callback and adds
     SSL_CTX_set_info_callback and SSL_set_state. Support for these functions is
     necessary to either detect renegotiation or to enforce
     renegotiation. Contributed by Steffen Ullrich. Thanks!
     Fixed a problem with SSL_set_state not available on some early OpenSSLs,
     patched by Steffen Ullrich. Thanks!
     Removed arbitrary size limits from calls to tcp_read_all in tcpcat() and
     http_cat().
     Removed unnecessary Debian_SPANTS.txt from MANIFEST. Again.

1.64 2014-06-11
     Fixes for test ocsp.t. Test now does not fail if HTTP::Tiny is not
     installed.
     Fixed repository in META.yml.
     Fixed a problem with SSL_get_peer_cert_chain: if the SSL handshake
     results in an anonymous authentication, like ADH-DES-CBC3-SHA,
     get_peer_cert_chain will not return an empty list, but instead return the
     SSL object. Reported and fixed by Steffen
     Ullrich. Thanks.
     Fixed a problem where patch
     https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commit;h=3009244da47b989c4cc59ba02cf81a4e9d8f8431
     caused a failed test in t/local/33_x509_create_cert.t.

1.63 2014-05-19
     Fixed error in version number in META.yml

1.62 2014-05-19
     Improvements to OCSP support: It turns out that some CA (like Verisign)
     sign the OCSP response with the CA we have in the trust store and don't
     attach this certifcate in the response.  But OpenSSL by itself only
     considers the certificates included in the response and
     SSL_OCSP_response_verify added the certificates in the chain too.
     Now, we also add the trusted CA from the store which
     signed the lowest chain certificate, at least if we could not verify the
     OCSP response without doing it. Patch from Steffen
     Ullrich. Thanks.
     Fixed some compiler warnings.

1.61 2014-05-12
     Changes calloc to Newx and free to Safefree, otherwise there might be
     problems because calloc is done from a different memory pool than free (depends
     on the build options for perl, but seen on Windows). Patch from Steffen
     Ullrich. Thanks.


1.60 2014-05-10
     Fixed a typo in an error message. Patch from gregor herrmann. Thanks.
     Fixed a problem with building with openssl that does not support
     OCSP. Also fixed some newly introduced warnings
     if compiled with -Wall. Patch from Steffen Ullrich. Thanks.
     fix build-failure on most Debian architectures:
     SSLeay.xs: In function 'XS_Net__SSLeay_OCSP_response_results':
     SSLeay.xs:5602:3: error: format not a string literal and no format
     arguments. Patch from  gregor herrmann.
     

1.59 2014-05-10
     Fixed local/30_error.t, so that tests do not fail if diagnostics are
     enabled.
     Fixed error messages about undefined strings used with length or
     split. Reported and patched by Peter Heuchert.
     Improvements to configuration of OPTIMIZE flags, to prevent overriding
     of perls expected optimization flags. Caution: HPUX aCC optimize options are special.
     SSL_peek() now returns openssl error code as second item when called in
     array context, same as SSL_read. Patch from Andreas Mohr.
     Fixed some warnings.
     Added support for tlsv1.1 tlsv1.2 via $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version. Patch
     from Andreas Mohr.
     Improve examples in 'Using other perl modules based on
     Net::SSLeay'. Patched by Andreas Mohr.
     Added support for OCSP. Patched by Steffen Ullrich. Thanks!
     Added missing t/external/ocsp.t

1.58 2014-01-15
     Always use size_t for strlen() return value, requested by Alexander Bluhm.
     t/external/20_cert_chain.t was missing from dist.
     Version number in META.yml was incorrect
     Improvements to test t/external/20_cert_chain.t to provoke following bug:
     Fixed crash due to SSL_get_peer_cert_chain incorrectly free'ing the chain
     after use.
     Fixed a problem when compiling against openssl where OPENSSL_NO_EC is set.

1.57 2014-01-09
     Fixed remaining problems with test suite: pod coverage and kwalitee tests
     are only enabled with RELEASE_TESTING=1

1.56 2014-01-08
     Fixed a typo in documentation of BEAST Attack, patched by gregor
     herrmann.
     Added LICENSE file copied form OpenSSL distribution to prevent complaints
     from various versions of kwalitee.
     Adjusted license: in META.yml to be 'openssl'
     Adds support for the basic operations necessary to support ECDH for PFS,
     e.g. EC_KEY_new_by_curve_name, EC_KEY_free and SSL_CTX_set_tmp_ecdh.
     Improvements to t/handle/external/50_external.t to handle the case when a
     test connection was not possible. Patched by Alexandr Ciornii.
     Added support for ALPN TLS extension. Patch from Lubomir Rintel. Tested
     with openssl-1.0.2-stable-SNAP-20131205.
     Fix an use-after-free error. Patch from Lubomir Rintel.
     Fixed a problem with  Invalid comparison on OBJ_cmp result in
     t/local/36_verify.t. Contributed by paul.
     Added support for get_peer_cert_chain(). Patch by Markus Benning.
     Fixed a bug that could cause stack faults: mixed up PUTBACK with SPAGAIN in ssleay_RSA_generate_key_cb_invoke()
     a final PUTBACK is needed here. A second issue is also fixed:
     cb->data defaults to &PL_sv_undef but throught the code you do not check
     against &PL_sv_undef, just NULL. 
     To avoid passing the 3rd optional arg at all, do not create it. This fixes all the 
     cb->data checks and wrong refcounts on &PL_sv_undef. Patched by Reini Urban.
     Deleted support for SSL_get_tlsa_record_byname: it is not included in
     OpenSSL git master. 

1.55 2013-06-08
     Added support for TLSV1_1 and TLSV1_2 methods with SSL_CTX_tlsv1_1_new(),
     SSL_CTX_tlsv1_2_new(), TLSv1_1_method() and TLSv1_2_method(), where
     available in the underlying openssl.
     Added CRL support functions X509_CRL_get_ext(), X509_CRL_get_ext_by_NID(),
     X509_CRL_get_ext_count(). Patch from Franck Youssef.
     Fixed a problem which could cause content with a value of '0' to not be
     correctly encoded by do_httpx3 and friends. Reported by Victor Efimov via
     RT.
     Added support for SSL_get_tlsa_record_byname() required for DANE support in
     openssl-1.0.2 and later. SSL_get_tlsa_record_byname() was added to
     OpenSSL with the financial assistance of .SE.
     Testing with openssl-1.0.2-stable-SNAP-20130521.
     Added X509_NAME_new and X509_NAME_hash, patched by Franck Youssef.
     Fixed a number of typos in pod file thanks to dsteinbrunner.

1.54 2013-03-23
     t/data/testcert_cdp.crt.pem_dump and t/data/testcert_cdp.crt.pem were
     missing from MANIFEST.
     Added MANIFEST to svn
     Improvement to test 07_sslecho.t so that if set_cert_and_key fails we
     can tell why.

1.53 2013-03-22
     Added support for SSL_export_keying_material where present (ie in OpenSSL
     1.0.1 and later).
     Changed t/handle/external/50_external.t to use www.airspayce.com instead of
     perldition.org, who no longer have an https server.
     Patch to fix a crash: P_X509_get_crl_distribution_points on an
     X509 certificate with values in the CDP extension which do not have an
     ia5 string will cause a segmentation fault when accessed. Patch from
     Robert Duncan.
     Change in t/local/32_x509_get_cert_info.t to not use
     Net::SSLeay::ASN1_INTEGER_get, since it works differntly on 32 and 64 bit platforms.
     Updated author and distribution location details to airspayce.com


1.52 2013-01-09
     Rebuild package with gnu format tar, to prevent problems with unpacking
     on other systems such as old Solaris,

1.51 2012-12-14
     Fixed a problem where SSL_set_SSL_CTX is not available with
     OpenSSL < 0.9.8f. Reported by Paul.

1.50 2012-12-13 
     Fixed a problem where t/handle/external/50_external.t would crash if any
     of the test sites were not contactable.
     Now builds on VMS. Patch kindly supplied by Craig A. Berry.
     Fixed a few compiler warnings in SSLeay.xs.  Most of them
     are just signed/unsigned pointer mismatches but there is one that actually
     fixes returning what would be an arbitrary value off the stack from
     get_my_thread_id if it happened to be called in a non-threaded build.
     Patch kindly supplied by Craig A. Berry.
     Added README.VMS, contributed by Craig A. Berry.
     Added SSL_set_tlsext_host_name, SSL_get_servername,
     SSL_get_servername_type, SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback for
     server side Server Name Indication (SNI) support. Patched by kmx.
     Further mods for VMS building supplied by Craig A. Berry.
     Fixed a problem with C++ comments preventing builds on AIX and
     HPUX. Patched by Gisle Aas.
     perdition.org not available for tests, changed to www.airspayce.com

     Fixed problem where on some platforms test t/local/07_tcpecho.t would
     bail out if it could not bind port 1212. Now now tries a number of ports to bind to until
     successful.
     Improvements to  unsigned casting contributed by Reini Urban.
     Improvements to Net::SSLeay::read to make it easier to use with non-blocking IO:
      contributed by James Marshall:  It modifies
      Net::SSLeay::read() to return the result from SSL_read() as the second
      return value, if Net::SSLeay::read() is called in list context.  Its
      behavior should be unchanged if called in scalar or void context.  This
      result code seems to be required for full support of non-blocking I/O,
      since users need to handle SSL_ERR_WANT_READ, SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE, etc.
      Fixed a problem where t/local/kwalitee.t fails with
       Module::CPANTS::Analyse 0.86. Patch from Paul.
      Fixed a number of typos patched by Giles.
      Fixed a compiler warning from Compiling with gcc-4.4 and -Wall, patched by Giles.	
      Fixed problems with get_https4: documentation was wrong, $header_ref was
       not correctly set and $server_cert was not returned.
      Fixed a problem that could cause a Perl exception about no blength
      method on undef. Reported by "Stephen J. Smith via RT". https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=79309 
      Added documentation about how to mitigatxe various SSL/TLS
     vulnerabilities.
     Fixed problem reported by Mike Doherty: SSL_MODE_* are defined in ssl.h, 
     and should be available as constants, but I do not see them listed in constants.h

1.48 2012-04-25
     Removed unneeded Debian_CPANTS.txt from MANIFEST.
     Fixed incorrect documentation about the best way to call CTX_set_options.
     Fixed problem that caused Undefined subroutine utf8::encode @
     t/local/33_x509_create_cert.t (on perl 5.6.2). Thanks to kmx.
     In examples and pod documentations, changed #!/usr/local/bin/perl to #!/usr/bin/perl.
     t/local/06_tcpecho.t now tries a number of ports to bind to until
     successful.

1.47 2012-04-04

     Group
     Fixed spelling errors in pod, patch from Salvatore Bonaccorso, Debian Perl
     Group

     Use my_snprintf from ppport.h to prevent link failures with perl 5.8 and
     earlier when compiled with MSVC.

1.46 2012-04-03
     Fixed a problem reported by Atoomic: 
      When bootstrapping Net::SSleay ( with DynaLoader ) if you override the SIG{DIE} signal, using 
      Net::SSLeay will result in an error.
      Recreated META.yml, added META.yml to dist
      Fixed typo: the word "corresponding" was mis-spelled as "coresponding"
       throughout the POD. Patched by kmx.

    - added couple more X509_STORE_CTX family functions
1.04  31.1.1999, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@@_iki._fi>
    - Backward incompatible changes in OpenSSL API mean that 1.04 will
      drop support for SSLeay and all OpenSSL versions prior
      to 0.9.2b release. Thanks guys!
    - Detected errors in OpenSSL-0.9.2b/ssl/ssl.h - see patch in README
    - Reordered arguments of several functions to track OpenSSL-0.9.2b
      changes. This also changes the order of args in corresponding
      perl functions. You have been warned!
        - SSL_use_certificate_ASN1(s,d,len)  // swapped d and len
    - WARNING: Possibly fatal verify_callback parameter list issue
      is still standing
    - cleaned up many macros that used to access ctx->session directly,
      OpenSSL-0.9.2b defines thes macros properly so I use them now.
    - Added SSL_ctrl() and SSL_CTX_ctrl()
    - Added SSL_get_options(), SSL_CTX_get_options(),
      SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list()
    - Removed SSL_add_session(), SSL_remove_session(),
          and SSL_flush_sessions() per #if 0 in ssl.h, line 667

    - upper case all header names so keys of the hash returned
      from get_https are predictible

      anymore. This used to cause headaches when connection
      renegotiation happened.
    - applied ssl_read_CRLF patch by Clinton Wong <clintdw@@netcom._com>
    - ActivePerl diffs from anton@@_genua.de applied,

      if scalar return value is used (they check this with wantarray).
      Change was suggested by Joe Rhett.
    - changed $trace levels so that 0 does not produce any output
    - changed get_https and put_https to fake error 900 in $response
      return field
    - changed print_errs and some other internals to return textual
      errors instead of error count
    - changed SSLeay.xs comments from #if 0 to #define REM. This will
      hopefully make it easier to compile with some vendor compilers
    - Added version detection code for OpenSSL-0.9.1c and checked
      build

    - changed build instructions to build outside perl source tree
    - added random number initialization using /dev/urandom (if available)
    - made ssl_write_all accept references, this is more memory efficient
1.00  19.6.1998, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@@_iki.fi>
    - overhauled to SSLeay-0.9.0
    - renamed cat to sslcat
    - added lots of convenience functions, like get_https

      #include <ssl_locl.h>, fixed typo in SSL_get_cerificate, fixed
      the return type of the same. --Sampo
0.03  Renamed everything Net::SSLeay
0.02  Trial with SSL.pm name
0.01  Thu Jun 27 03:56:00 1996
