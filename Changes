Revision history for Perl extension Net::SSLeay.

?? ????-??-??
	- Add functions functions to allow reading multiple pems from
	  file and creating untrusted chain: These functions allow you
	  to:
	  - Read in a PEM file with multiple certificates as a
	    STACK_OF(X509_INFO)
	  - Determine the size of the STACK_OF(X509_INFO) and value at
	    an index, which allows you to loop over the stack.
	  - Retrieve the X509 structure from each X509_INFO structure
	    in the stack.
	  Then you can create a new STACK_OF(X509) and push the X509
	  structures onto the new stack. You can then pass this
	  STACK_OF(X509) to X509_STORE_CTX_init which will allow you
	  to add additional untrusted certificates to the chain for
	  verification. Exposed functions are:
	  PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio
	  sk_X509_INFO_num
	  sk_X509_INFO_value
	  sk_X509_INFO_free
	  sk_X509_new_null
	  sk_X509_free
	  sk_X509_push
	  New function implemented by Net::SSLeay:
	  P_X509_INFO_get_x509
	  Thanks to Marc Reisner.
	- Add functions and constants that are necessary to verify a
	  certificate using a hash directory outside of an SSL/TLS
	  connection. Newly exposed functions:
	  X509_STORE_CTX_init
	  X509_STORE_CTX_free
	  X509_STORE_new
	  X509_STORE_free
	  X509_STORE_add_lookup
	  X509_LOOKUP_hash_dir
	  X509_LOOKUP_add_dir
	  Newly exposed constants:
	  X509_FILETYPE_ASN1
	  X509_FILETYPE_DEFAULT
	  X509_FILETYPE_PEM
	  Thanks to Marc Reisner.
	- Declare n_a in ssleay_set_psk_client_callback_invoke and
	  ssleay_ctx_set_psk_client_callback_invoke to avoid a compilation
	  error with Perl versions below 5.8.8. Fixes RT#128030. Thanks to
	  Graham Ollis for the report.
	- Add X509_get0_serialNumber. Thanks to Marc Reisner.
	- Enable Travis CI for LibreSSL 2.2.1, 2.7.5, 2.8.3 and 2.9.0
	  on Perl 5.20 and more recent.

1.86_07 2018-12-13
        - Net::SSLeay::RSA_generate_key() now prefers using
          RSA_generate_key_ex. This avois deprecated RSA_generate_key
          and allows removing the only Android specific code in
          SSLeay.xs. Fixes RT#127593. Thanks to Rouven Weiler.
	- SSL_CTX_get0_param, SSL_CTX_get0_param,
	  X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host, X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add1_host,
	  X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_hostflags,
	  X509_VERIFY_PARAM_get0_peername,
	  X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_email, X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_ip and
	  X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_ip_asc added in 1.83 for OpenSSL
	  1.0.2 and later are now available with LibreSSL 2.7.0 and
	  later.
	- get_keyblock_size() now gets the MAC secret size from the
	  cipher on LibreSSL 2.7.0 and later, rather than reaching
	  into libssl internals. This effectively takes the OpenSSL
	  1.1 code path for LibreSSL 2.7.0 instead of the OpenSSL 1.0
	  code path.  Thanks to Alexander Bluhm.
	- get_client_random and get_server_random now use API
	  functions supported by LibreSSL 2.7.0 and later. Thanks to
	  Alexander Bluhm.
	- Add X509_check_host(), X509_check_email(), X509_check_ip(),
	  and X509_check_ip_asc() for LibreSSL 2.5.0 and later. Thanks
	  to Alexander Bluhm.
        - OpenSSL_version() and OpenSSL_version_num() are available
          with LibreSSL 2.7.0 and later. Thanks to Alexander Bluhm.
        - Use OPENSSL_cleanse() instead of memset(). Fixes
          RT#116599. Thanks to A. Sinan Unur.

1.86_06 2018-09-29
	- Net::SSLeay::read() and SSL_peek() now check SSL_get_error()
	  for SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN for return values <= 0 to make
	  Net::SSLeay::read() behave more like underlying OpenSSL
	  function SSL_read().
	  Convenience function ssl_read_all() now does an automatic
	  retry when ERROR_WANT_READ or ERROR_WANT_WRITE is returned
	  with Net::SSLeay::read().
	  Convenience function ssl_read_until() now uses
	  Net::SSLeay::ssl_read_all() instead of
	  Net::SSLeay::read(). Tests 07_sslecho.t and 36_verify.t were
	  also updated to use ssl_read_all() and ssl_write_all(). The
	  tests now also disable TLSv1.3 session tickets and ignore
	  SIGPIPE to avoid this signal when the client has finished
	  before server has sent session tickets and called
	  Net::SSLeay::accept().
	  Thanks to Petr Pisar and Sebastian Andrzej Siewior for the
	  patches (in #RT125218).
	- Fix a memory leak in cb_data_advanced_put. Fixes
	  RT#127131. Noticed, investigated and patched by Paul
	  Evans. Thanks!
	- Enable OpenSSL 1.1.1-pre9 with Travis CI.
	- Add SSL_CTX_set_num_tickets, SSL_CTX_get_num_tickets,
	  SSL_set_num_ticket and SSL_get_num_tickets for controlling
	  the number of TLSv1.3 session tickets that are issued.  Add
	  tests in 44_sess.t. Parts taken from a larger patch by Petr
	  Pisar of RedHat.
	- Add SSL_CTX_set_ciphersuites and SSL_set_ciphersuites for
	  configuring the available TLSv1.3 ciphersuites. Add tests in
	  43_misc_functions.t and clarify SSL_client_version tests.
	- Add SSL_CTX_set_security_level, SSL_CTX_get_security_level,
	  SSL_set_security_level and SSL_get_security_level.
	  Add new test file 65_security_level.t.
	  All courtesy of Damyan Ivanov of Debian project.
	- Fix export_keying_material return value check and context
	  handling. SSL_export_keying_material use_context is now
	  correctly set to non-zero value when context is an empty
	  string. This affects values exported with TLSv1.2 and earlier.
	  Update documentation in NetSSLeay.pod and add tests
	  in t/local/45_export.t.
	- Add RAND_priv_bytes. Add new test file t/local/10_rand.t for
	  RAND_bytes, RAND_pseudo_bytes, RAND_priv_bytes, RAND_status,
	  RAND_poll, RAND_file_name and RAND_load_file.
	- Update documentation for RAND_*bytes return values and
	  RAND_file_name behaviour with LibreSSL.
	- Add SSL_SESSION_is_resumable. Add and update tests in 44_sess.t.
	- Set OpenSSL security level to 1 in tests that use the test suite's
	  (1024-bit) RSA keys, which allows the test suite to pass when
	  Net-SSLeay is built against an OpenSSL with a higher default
	  security level. Fixes RT#126987. Thanks to Petr Pisar (in
	  RT#126270) and Damyan Ivanov (in RT#126987) for the reports and
	  patches, and to Damyan Ivanov for the preferred patch.
	- Add SSL_CTX_sess_set_new_cb and SSL_CTX_sess_set_remove_cb.
	  Add new test file 44_sess.t for these and future session
	  related tests for which no specific test file is needed.
	- Add SSL_get_version, SSL_client_version and SSL_is_dtls.
	- Add SSL_peek_ex, SSL_read_ex, SSL_write_ex and SSL_has_pending.
	  Add tests in t/local/11_read.t
	- Add SSL_CTX_set_post_handshake_auth contributed by Paul
	  Howarth. Add SSL_set_post_handshake_auth,
	  SSL_verify_client_post_handshake and constant
	  SSL_VERIFY_POST_HANDSHAKE.
	- Applied a patch to set_cert_and_key() from Damyan Ivanov,
	  Debian Perl Group. This function now returns errors from
	  library's error stack only when an underlying routine
	  fails. Unrelated errors are now skipped. Fixes RT#126988.
	- Add support for TLSv1.3 via $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version.
	- Enhance t/local/43_misc_functions.t get_keyblock_size test
	  to work better with AEAD ciphers.
	- Add constants SSL_OP_ENABLE_MIDDLEBOX_COMPAT and
	  SSL_OP_NO_ANTI_REPLAY for TLSv1.3
	- Fix compile time DEFINE=-DSHOW_XS_DEBUG to work with
	  non-threaded Perls. Fixes RT#127027. Thanks to SREZIC for
	  the report. Also fix other minor compile warnings.

1.86_05 2018-08-22
	- Net-SSLeay now requires at least Perl 5.8.1. This is a
	  formalisation of what has been the de facto case for some time,
	  as the distribution hasn't compiled and passed its tests on Perl
	  5.005 for several years.
	- Increment Net::SSLeay::Handle's version number to keep it in sync
	  with Net::SSLeay's, thus satisfying Kwalitee's consistent_version
	  metric.
	- Re-enable the d2i_X509_bio() test in t/local/33_x509_create_cert.t
	  for LibreSSL. Thanks to Alexander Bluhm.
	- Automatically detect new library names on Windows for OpenSSL
	  1.1.0 onwards (libcrypto, libssl). Fixes part of RT#121084. Thanks
	  to Jean-Damien Durand.
	- Fix a typo preventing OpenSSL libraries built with the VC compiler
	  (i.e. ones with a ".lib" suffix) from being automatically detected
	  on Windows. Fixes part of RT#121084. Thanks to Jean-Damien Durand.
	- Add missing call to va_end() following va_start() in TRACE().
	  Fixes RT#126028. Thanks to Jitka Plesnikova.
	- Added SSL_in_init() and the related functions for all
	  libraries and their versions. All return 0 or 1 as
	  documented by OpenSSL 1.1.1. Use of these functions is
	  recommended over using constants returned by get_state() and
	  state(). New constants TLS_ST_*, used by OpenSSL 1.1.0 and
	  later, will not be made available by Net::SSLeay.

1.86_04 2018-07-30
	- Re-add SSLv3_method() for OpenSSL 1.0.2 and above. Fixes
	  RT#101484.
	- Don't expose ENGINE-related functions when building against
	  OpenSSL builds without ENGINE support. Fixes RT#121538. Thanks to
	  Paul Green.
	- Automatically detect OpenSSL 1.0.x on VMS, and update VMS
	  installation instructions to reflect removal of Module::Install
	  from the build system. Fixes RT#124388. Thanks to Craig A. Berry.
	- Prevent memory leak in OCSP_cert2ids() and OCSP_response_verify().
	  Fixes RT#125273. Thanks to Steffen Ullrich.

1.86_03 2018-07-19
	- Convert packaging to ExtUtils::MakeMaker. Thanks to mohawk2.
	- Module::Install is no longer a prerequisite when building
	  from the reposistory.
	- Re-apply patch from ETJ permitting configure and build in
	  places with a space in the name.

1.86_02 2018-07-06
	- Removed inc/ from repository. Module::Install is now a
	  prerequisite when building from the repository. This allowed
	  also removing "." from Makefile.PL lib path which was added
	  in version 1.81. These updates require no changes when
	  building from release packages. They also help AppVeyor
	  builds to work better with old Perls.

	- Added CONTRIBUTING.md, reformatted the previous Changes
          entry to use CPAN::Changes::Spec guidelines and removed
          unused version control tags from comments.

1.86_01 2018-07-04
	[Version control system change]
	- Chris Novakovic did a full conversion from the old Debian
	  hosted SVN repository to git.

	- Fixes to commit metadata, branches and tags that git-svn
	  couldn't handle or had no way of handling, were done
	  manually or semi-automatically afterwards. For instance, the
	  "git-svn-id:" lines that git-svn appends to commit messages
	  were kept because Mike used SVN revision numbers in RT
	  replies to indicate when bugs had been fixed/patches applied
	  (which may be useful for future reference).

	- All commits were replayed onto a single master branch rather
	  than having separate dead-end branches for the old SVN
	  version tags (as this seems more "git-like").

	- New lightweight tags were created for each public release
	  going back as far as the start of the SVN repository using
	  data from MetaCPAN (cross-referencing with the changelog
	  when it wasn't clear when a release was cut from the SVN
	  repo).

	- Florian's and Mike's email addresses were mapped to git
	  author/committer IDs

	[Continuous integration]
	- Travis CI configuration was added for automated testing on
	   Linux using 64 bit Ubuntu Trusty. Build matrix dimensions
	   are: Perl 5.8 - 5.26 x OpenSSL 0.9.8zh - 1.1.0h. Only the
	   currently latest version for each major Perl and OpenSSL
	   release is chosen.

	- AppVeyor configuration was added for automated testing on
	  Windows. Build matrix dimensions are: Perl 5.8 - 5.26 x
	  32bit and 64bit Perl environment x Windows Server 2012R2 and
	  Windows Server 2016. The Perl environment is Strawberry Perl
	  and its OpenSSL is used with builds. Only the latest major
	  versions are used, similarly to Travis CI. Net-SSLeay PPM
	  and PPD files are made available as artifacts.

	- Added README.md with link to master branch build and test
	  status. Did minor updates to README and other misc files.

	[Release packaging]
	- Files t/local/43_misc_functions.t and
	  t/local/65_ticket_sharing_2.t were missing from MANIFEST.

	- Updated inc/ directory with Module::Install 1.19. Updated
	  Makefile.PL author and resource information. Synced
	  SSLeay.pm under ext/ with the latest changes under
	  inc/. Reordered use imports so that META.yml gets correctly
	  regenerated. More Module::Install related changes will
	  follow.

	[Repository amd maintainer change]
	- Net::SSLeay functionality was not changed in this
	  release. Work was done to switch version contorol systems,
	  add automated testing, update module packaging and change
	  the primary maintainer. This coincided with the decommission
	  of previous code repository service on alioth.debian.org.

	- The module is now primarily maintained by Tuure Vartiainen
	  and Heikki Vatiainen of Radiator Software. The new
	  repository location is
	  https://github.com/radiator-software/p5-net-ssleay

1.85 2018-03-14
	Preparations for transferring maintenace to a new maintainer
	Fixed test failure in t/local/33_x509_create_cert.t for some version of OpenSSL.
	Fixed free() error that causes "Free to wrong pool ..." merssage on Windows.
	Reported and patched by Steffen Ullrich.
	
1.84 2018-01-17
	Fixed an error in t/local/04_basic.t causing a test failure if
	Test::Exception not installed. Reported by Joel Berger.
	
1.83 2018-01-16
	Fixed a problem with exporting OPENSSL_NO_NEXTPROTONEG even though they are not availble on LibreSSL.
	Patch patch-SSLeay_xs-NO_NPN from Alexander Bluhm.
	Patch from Heikki Vatiainen adds support for SSL_set_default_passwd_cb* for 
	OpenSSL 1.1.0f and later. LibreSSL does not support these functions, at 
	least yet.
	Patch from Heikki Vatiainen adds new functions related to SSL_CTX_new.
	Patch from Heikki Vatiainen adds two new functions introduced in OpenSSL 1.1.0, a number 
	of constants and a couple of const qualifiers to SSLeay.xs. Tests and 
	documentation .pod were also updated.
	Patch from Heikki Vatiainen adds one new OpenSSL 1.1.0 function and has a minor fix for 
	LibreSSL version detection:	    
	*   Added support for SSL_use_certificate_chain_file
     	function introduced in OpenSSL 1.1.0.
	*   Fixed LibreSSL version detection to correctly parse
     	LibreSSL minor version.
	Patch from Steffen Ulrich to fix memory leaks in OCSP handling. Thanks.
	Patch from Heikki Vatiainen adds new functions for certificate verification introduced in 
	OpenSSL 1.02, a number of constants, new test data files, new tests and 
	updates to .pod documentation.
	The new functions provide access to the built-in wildcard check 
	functionality available in OpenSSL 1.0.2 and later.
	The patch also adds new tests for the new functions and updates some of 
	the current tests for CTX_set_default_passwd_cb* functions.
	Added X509_STORE_CTX_new and X509_verify_cert.
	SSL_OCSP_response_verify now clears the error queue if OCSP_basic_verify fails but the
	intermediate certificate succeeds. Patch from Stefan Ullrich.


1.82 2017-10-31
	Added support for building under Linuxbrew (a linuxbrew version of MacOS Homebrew)
	Patch from Matthew Altus, that implements SSL_CTX_set_psk_client_callback() and SSL_set_psk_client_callback().
	Patch to build with LibreSSL has no support for NPN
	Also skip the NPN test if the SSL library is LibreSSL.
	Fixed a problem with a variable declaration in ssleay_session_secret_cb_invoke reported by Graham Ollis.
	Significant patch set from Open System Consultants:
	- Bugfix: tlsext_status_cb_invoke(...): free ocsp_response only when allocated.
 	- The same callback is used on a server side for OCSP stapling and in that 
  	 case ocsp_response is NULL and not used.
	 - New feature: Added a binding SSL_set_session_ticket_ext_cb(ssl,callback,data)
	 - A callback used by EAP-FAST/EAP-TEAT to parse and process TLS session ticket.
	 - Tests are in t/local/65_ticket_sharing_2.t
	 - New feature: Added a binding SSL_set_session_ticket_ext(ssl,ticket)
	 - Used by EAP-FAST/EAP-TEAP to define TLS session ticket value.
	 - Tests are in t/local/65_ticket_sharing_2.t
	 - Bugfix: tlsext_ticket_key_cb_invoke(...): allow SHA256 HMAC key to be 32 bytes 
	 instead of 16 bytes (which OpenSSL will pad with zeros up to 32 bytes).
	 - New feature: Added following bindings:
	 - X509_get_ex_data(cert,idx)
	 - X509_get_ex_new_index(argl,argp,new_func,dup_funL,free_func)
	 - X509_get_app_data(cert)
	 - X509_set_ex_data(cert,idx,data)
	 - X509_set_app_data(cert,arg)
	 - X509_STORE_CTX_get_ex_new_index(argl,argp,new_func,dup_func,free_func)
	 - X509_STORE_CTX_get_app_data(x509_store_ctx)
	 - X509_STORE_CTX_set_app_data(x509_store_ctx,arg)
	 - New feature: Added an implementation for SSL_get_finished(ssl,buf,count=2*EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE)
	 - Tests are in t/local/43_misc_functions.t
	 - New feature: Added an implementation for SSL_get_peer_finished(ssl,buf,count=2*EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE)
	 - Tests are in t/local/43_misc_functions.t
	 - Bugfix: SSL_get_keyblock_size(s): Calculate key block size correctly also with AEAD ciphers
	 which don’t use digest functions.
	 - New feature: Added a binding SSL_set_tlsext_status_ocsp_resp(ssl,staple)
	 - Used by a server side to include OCSP staple in ServerHello.
	 - Bugfix: SSL_OCSP_response_verify(ssl,rsp,svreq,flags): check that chain and last are not NULL 
	 before trying to use them.
	 - Bugfix: inc/Module/Install/PRIVATE/Net/SSLeay.pm: Don’t quote include and lib paths.

1.81	 2017-03-28
	Patch from Alexander Bluhm to enable RSA_get_key_parameters with
	LibreSSL. Again.
	Fixed memory leak in X509_get_subjectAltNames. Reported and patched by Jim Westfall.
	Added . to lib path in Makefile.PL and t/local/32_x509_get_cert_info.t
	to accommodate people who are using a perl with -Ddefault_inc_excludes_dot
	or perl 25 or later.
	Fixed build failure if engine support not present. Patch from Paul Green.
	Improvements to  get_my_thread_id to work around possibility of ERRSV not being defined eg on OpenWRT.
	Patch from ETJ permitting configure and build in places with a space in the name.
	
1.80	 2017-01-05
	 Patch from Steffen Ulrich that fixed unexpected changes in the
	 control flow of the Perl program which seemed to be triggered by the
	 ticket key callback. Thanks Steffen.

1.79	 2017-01-03
	Patch to fix a few inline variable declarations that cause errors for
	older compilers. From Andy Grundman. Thanks.
	Patch: Generated C code is not compatible with MSVC, AIX cc,
	probably others. Added some PREINIT blocks and replaced 2 cases of INIT with
	PREINIT. From Andy Grundman. Thanks.
	Patch to fix: Fails to compile if the OpenSSL library it's built
	against has compression support compiled out. From Stephan
	Wall. Thanks.
	Added RSA_get_key_parameters() to return a list of pointers to RSA key
	internals.
	Patch to fix some documentation typos courtesy gregor herrmann.
	RSA_get_key_parameters() is now only available prior OpenSSL 1.1.
	Testing with openssl-1.1.0b.

1.78	 2016-08-13
	 Fixed broken OCSP code and tests. Broken since 1.75. Patched by
	 Steffen Ullrich. Thanks.

1.77	 2016-08-01
	 Fixed incorrect size to memset in tlsext_ticket_key_cb_invoke.

1.76	 2016-07-31
	 Replaced bzero with memset. Bzero not present on windows.

1.75  2016-07-31
     Compatibility with OpenSSL 1.1, tested with openssl-1.1.0-pre5:
     - Conditionally remove threading locking code, not needed in 1.1
     - Rewrite code that accesses inside X509_ATTRIBUTE struct.
     - SSL_CTX_need_tmp_RSA, SSL_CTX_set_tmp_rsa,
       SSL_CTX_set_tmp_rsa_callback, SSL_set_tmp_rsa_callback support
       not available in 1.1.
     - SSL_session_reused is now native
     - SSL_get_keyblock_size modifed to use new API
     - OCSP functions modified to use new API under 1.1
     - SSL_set_state removed with 1.1
     - SSL_get_state and SSL_state are now equivalent and available in all
       versions
     - SSL_CTX_v2_new removed
     - SESSION_set_master_key removed with 1.1. Code that previously used
       SESSION_set_master_key must now set $secret in the session_secret
       callback set with SSL_set_session_secret_cb
     - With 1.1, $secret in the session_secret
       callback set with SSL_set_session_secret_cb can be changed to alter
       the master key (required by EAP-FAST).
     Added a function EC_KEY_generate_key similar to RSA_generate_key and a
     function EVP_PKEY_assign_EC_KEY similar to EVP_PKEY_assign_RSA. Using
     these functions it is easy to create and use EC keys in the same way as
     RSA keys. Patch provided by Steffen Ullrich. Thanks Steffen.
     Testing with LibreSSL 2.4.1, with compatibility patch from Steffen
     Ullrich. Thanks Steffen.
     Patch from Steffen Ulrich provides  support for cross context (and cross process)
     session sharing using the stateless TLS session tickets. It uses the
     SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_ticket_key_cb function to manage the encryption and
     decryption of the tickets but provides a more simplified
     interface. Includes new function CTX_set_tlsext_ticket_getkey_cb.
     To not conflict with the OpenSSL name in case the more complex interface
     will be implemented ever the current simplified interface is called
     slightly different: CTX_set_tlsext_ticket_*get*key_cb. 
     Added documentation about downloading latest version from SVN.
     Added missing Module/install files to SVN.

1.74 2016-04-12
     README.OSX was missing from the distribution

1.73 2016-04-11
     Added X509_get_X509_PUBKEY. Patch supplied by GUILHEM. Thanks.
     Added README.OSX with instructions on how to build for recent OS X.
     Added info about using OPENSSL_PREFIX to README.Win32.
     Added comments in POD about installation documentation.
     Added '/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin/openssl' to Openssl search path for
     latest version of  OSX homebrew openssl. Patch from Shoichi Kaji.

1.72 2015-09-22
     Fixed a problem where SvPVx_nolen was undefined in some versions of
     perl. Reported by Karen Etheridge. Replaced with SvPV_nolen.
     Fixed a cast warning on Darwin reported by Karen Etheridge. 

1.71 2015-09-18
     Patch from Ben Kaduk: Conditionalise support for MD4, MD5.
     Added support for linking libraries in /usr/local/lib64 for some flavours
     of Linux like RH Tikanga. 
     Fixes to X509_check_host, X509_check_ip, SSL_CTX_set_alpn_protos, and
     SSL_set_alpn_protos so they will compile on MSVC and AIX cc. Thanks to
     AGRUNDMA.
     Fixed typos in documentation for X509_NAME_new and X509_NAME_hash
     incorrect version 1.45 instead of 1.55 given.
     Version number in META.yml is now quoted per request from Satoshi Yagi.
     

1.70 2015-06-26
     Patch from Alexander Bluhm: The new OpenSSL 1.0.2 X509_check_* functions are not available in
     current LibreSSL.  So disable them in SSLeay.xs.
     Fixed a problem with building against OSX homebrew's openssl. Patch from
     Shoichi Kaji.
     Removed a test in t/local/33_x509_create_cert.t which fails due to
     changes in 1.0.1n and later

1.69 2015-06-04
     Testing with OpenSSL 1.0.2, 1.0.2a. OK.
     Completed LibreSSL compatibility with the kind assistance of Alexander
     Bluhm.
     Improved compatibility with OpenSSL 1.0.2a as suggested by Petr Pisar.
     Added the X509_check_* functions introduced in OpenSSL 1.0.2, contributed
     by Carsten Gaebler.
     Added support for X509_V_FLAG_TRUSTED_FIRST constant, patch from Gisle Aas.
     Patch allows get_keyblock_size to work correctly with 
     OpenSSL 1.0.1 and later versions. Contributed by Heikki Vatiainen.

1.68 2015-01-24
     Fixed a problem on OSX when macports openssl 1.x is installed: headers from
     macport were found but older OSX openssl libraries were linked, resulting
     in "Symbol not found: _EVP_MD_do_all_sorted".
     Added notes about runtime error "no OPENSSL_Applink", when calling
     Net::SSLeay::P_PKCS12_load_file.


1.67 2015-01-17
     Improvements to inc/Module/Install/PRIVATE/Net/SSLeay.pm to handle the
     case whe there are muliple OPENSSLs installed. Patch from HBRAND
     Fixed a documentation error in get_peer_cert_chain, reported by tejas.
     Fixed a problem with building on Windows that prevented correct OpenSSL
     directory detection with version 1.0.1j as delivered with Shining Light OpenSSL.
     Fixed a problem with building on Windows that prevented finding MT or MD
     versions of SSL libraries.
     Updated doc in README.Win32 to build with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express.
     Added Windows crypt32 library to Windows linking as some compilers/platforms seem to
     require it and it is innocuous otherwise. For Steve Hay.
     Fixed a failure in t/external/20_cert_chain.t where some platforms do not
     have HTTPS in /etc/services. Reported and patched by Gisle Aas.
     Recent 1.0.2 betas have dropped the SSLv3_method function. 
     This patch leaves out the function on newer versions, much the same as
     the SSLv2 deprecation is handled. Patch from Tom Molesworth.
     Fix the ALPN test, which was incorrectly failing on OpenSSL due to the
     LibreSSL check (earlier versions bailed out before that line).Patch from
     Tom Molesworth. 

1.66 2014-08-21
     Fixed compile problem with perl prior to 5.8.8, similar to
     RT#76267. Reported by Graham Knop.
     Fixed a problem with Socket::IPPROTO_TCP on early perls.
     After discussions with the community and the original author Sampo
     Kellomaki, the license conditions have been changed to "Perl Artisitic
     License 2.0".


1.65  2014-07-14
     Added note to doc to make it clear that X509_get_subjectAltNames returns a
     packed binary IP address for type 7 - GEN_IPADD.
     Improvements to SSL_OCSP_response_verify to compile under non c99
     compilers. Requested by MERIJNB.
     Port to Android, contributed by Brian Fraser. Includes Android specific
     version of RSA_generate_key.
     Added LibreSSL support, patch provided by Alexander Bluhm. Thanks!
     Patch that fixes the support for SSL_set_info_callback and adds
     SSL_CTX_set_info_callback and SSL_set_state. Support for these functions is
     necessary to either detect renegotiation or to enforce
     renegotiation. Contributed by Steffen Ullrich. Thanks!
     Fixed a problem with SSL_set_state not available on some early OpenSSLs,
     patched by Steffen Ullrich. Thanks!
     Removed arbitrary size limits from calls to tcp_read_all in tcpcat() and
     http_cat().
     Removed unnecessary Debian_SPANTS.txt from MANIFEST. Again.

1.64 2014-06-11
     Fixes for test ocsp.t. Test now does not fail if HTTP::Tiny is not
     installed.
     Fixed repository in META.yml.
     Fixed a problem with SSL_get_peer_cert_chain: if the SSL handshake
     results in an anonymous authentication, like ADH-DES-CBC3-SHA,
     get_peer_cert_chain will not return an empty list, but instead return the
     SSL object. Reported and fixed by Steffen
     Ullrich. Thanks.
     Fixed a problem where patch
     https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commit;h=3009244da47b989c4cc59ba02cf81a4e9d8f8431
     caused a failed test in t/local/33_x509_create_cert.t.

1.63 2014-05-19
     Fixed error in version number in META.yml

1.62 2014-05-19
     Improvements to OCSP support: It turns out that some CA (like Verisign)
     sign the OCSP response with the CA we have in the trust store and don't
     attach this certifcate in the response.  But OpenSSL by itself only
     considers the certificates included in the response and
     SSL_OCSP_response_verify added the certificates in the chain too.
     Now, we also add the trusted CA from the store which
     signed the lowest chain certificate, at least if we could not verify the
     OCSP response without doing it. Patch from Steffen
     Ullrich. Thanks.
     Fixed some compiler warnings.

1.61 2014-05-12
     Changes calloc to Newx and free to Safefree, otherwise there might be
     problems because calloc is done from a different memory pool than free (depends
     on the build options for perl, but seen on Windows). Patch from Steffen
     Ullrich. Thanks.


1.60 2014-05-10
     Fixed a typo in an error message. Patch from gregor herrmann. Thanks.
     Fixed a problem with building with openssl that does not support
     OCSP. Also fixed some newly introduced warnings
     if compiled with -Wall. Patch from Steffen Ullrich. Thanks.
     fix build-failure on most Debian architectures:
     SSLeay.xs: In function 'XS_Net__SSLeay_OCSP_response_results':
     SSLeay.xs:5602:3: error: format not a string literal and no format
     arguments. Patch from  gregor herrmann.
     

1.59 2014-05-10
     Fixed local/30_error.t, so that tests do not fail if diagnostics are
     enabled.
     Fixed error messages about undefined strings used with length or
     split. Reported and patched by Peter Heuchert.
     Improvements to configuration of OPTIMIZE flags, to prevent overriding
     of perls expected optimization flags. Caution: HPUX aCC optimize options are special.
     SSL_peek() now returns openssl error code as second item when called in
     array context, same as SSL_read. Patch from Andreas Mohr.
     Fixed some warnings.
     Added support for tlsv1.1 tlsv1.2 via $Net::SSLeay::ssl_version. Patch
     from Andreas Mohr.
     Improve examples in 'Using other perl modules based on
     Net::SSLeay'. Patched by Andreas Mohr.
     Added support for OCSP. Patched by Steffen Ullrich. Thanks!
     Added missing t/external/ocsp.t

1.58 2014-01-15
     Always use size_t for strlen() return value, requested by Alexander Bluhm.
     t/external/20_cert_chain.t was missing from dist.
     Version number in META.yml was incorrect
     Improvements to test t/external/20_cert_chain.t to provoke following bug:
     Fixed crash due to SSL_get_peer_cert_chain incorrectly free'ing the chain
     after use.
     Fixed a problem when compiling against openssl where OPENSSL_NO_EC is set.

1.57 2014-01-09
     Fixed remaining problems with test suite: pod coverage and kwalitee tests
     are only enabled with RELEASE_TESTING=1

1.56 2014-01-08
     Fixed a typo in documentation of BEAST Attack, patched by gregor
     herrmann.
     Added LICENSE file copied form OpenSSL distribution to prevent complaints
     from various versions of kwalitee.
     Adjusted license: in META.yml to be 'openssl'
     Adds support for the basic operations necessary to support ECDH for PFS,
     e.g. EC_KEY_new_by_curve_name, EC_KEY_free and SSL_CTX_set_tmp_ecdh.
     Improvements to t/handle/external/50_external.t to handle the case when a
     test connection was not possible. Patched by Alexandr Ciornii.
     Added support for ALPN TLS extension. Patch from Lubomir Rintel. Tested
     with openssl-1.0.2-stable-SNAP-20131205.
     Fix an use-after-free error. Patch from Lubomir Rintel.
     Fixed a problem with  Invalid comparison on OBJ_cmp result in
     t/local/36_verify.t. Contributed by paul.
     Added support for get_peer_cert_chain(). Patch by Markus Benning.
     Fixed a bug that could cause stack faults: mixed up PUTBACK with SPAGAIN in ssleay_RSA_generate_key_cb_invoke()
     a final PUTBACK is needed here. A second issue is also fixed:
     cb->data defaults to &PL_sv_undef but throught the code you do not check
     against &PL_sv_undef, just NULL. 
     To avoid passing the 3rd optional arg at all, do not create it. This fixes all the 
     cb->data checks and wrong refcounts on &PL_sv_undef. Patched by Reini Urban.
     Deleted support for SSL_get_tlsa_record_byname: it is not included in
     OpenSSL git master. 

1.55 2013-06-08
     Added support for TLSV1_1 and TLSV1_2 methods with SSL_CTX_tlsv1_1_new(),
     SSL_CTX_tlsv1_2_new(), TLSv1_1_method() and TLSv1_2_method(), where
     available in the underlying openssl.
     Added CRL support functions X509_CRL_get_ext(), X509_CRL_get_ext_by_NID(),
     X509_CRL_get_ext_count(). Patch from Franck Youssef.
     Fixed a problem which could cause content with a value of '0' to not be
     correctly encoded by do_httpx3 and friends. Reported by Victor Efimov via
     RT.
     Added support for SSL_get_tlsa_record_byname() required for DANE support in
     openssl-1.0.2 and later. SSL_get_tlsa_record_byname() was added to
     OpenSSL with the financial assistance of .SE.
     Testing with openssl-1.0.2-stable-SNAP-20130521.
     Added X509_NAME_new and X509_NAME_hash, patched by Franck Youssef.
     Fixed a number of typos in pod file thanks to dsteinbrunner.

1.54 2013-03-23
     t/data/testcert_cdp.crt.pem_dump and t/data/testcert_cdp.crt.pem were
     missing from MANIFEST.
     Added MANIFEST to svn
     Improvement to test 07_sslecho.t so that if set_cert_and_key fails we
     can tell why.

1.53 2013-03-22
     Added support for SSL_export_keying_material where present (ie in OpenSSL
     1.0.1 and later).
     Changed t/handle/external/50_external.t to use www.airspayce.com instead of
     perldition.org, who no longer have an https server.
     Patch to fix a crash: P_X509_get_crl_distribution_points on an
     X509 certificate with values in the CDP extension which do not have an
     ia5 string will cause a segmentation fault when accessed. Patch from
     Robert Duncan.
     Change in t/local/32_x509_get_cert_info.t to not use
     Net::SSLeay::ASN1_INTEGER_get, since it works differntly on 32 and 64 bit platforms.
     Updated author and distribution location details to airspayce.com


1.52 2013-01-09
     Rebuild package with gnu format tar, to prevent problems with unpacking
     on other systems such as old Solaris,

1.51 2012-12-14
     Fixed a problem where SSL_set_SSL_CTX is not available with
     OpenSSL < 0.9.8f. Reported by Paul.

1.50 2012-12-13 
     Fixed a problem where t/handle/external/50_external.t would crash if any
     of the test sites were not contactable.
     Now builds on VMS. Patch kindly supplied by Craig A. Berry.
     Fixed a few compiler warnings in SSLeay.xs.  Most of them
     are just signed/unsigned pointer mismatches but there is one that actually
     fixes returning what would be an arbitrary value off the stack from
     get_my_thread_id if it happened to be called in a non-threaded build.
     Patch kindly supplied by Craig A. Berry.
     Added README.VMS, contributed by Craig A. Berry.
     Added SSL_set_tlsext_host_name, SSL_get_servername,
     SSL_get_servername_type, SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback for
     server side Server Name Indication (SNI) support. Patched by kmx.
     Further mods for VMS building supplied by Craig A. Berry.
     Fixed a problem with C++ comments preventing builds on AIX and
     HPUX. Patched by Gisle Aas.
     perdition.org not available for tests, changed to www.airspayce.com
     Added SSL_FIPS_mode_set
     Improvements to test suite so it succeeds with and without FIPS mode
     enabled. Patch supplied by Petr Pisar.
     Added documentation, warning not to pass UTF-8 data in the content
     argument to post_https. Reported by Jason Terry.

1.49 2012-09-25
     Fixed problem where on some platforms test t/local/07_tcpecho.t would
     bail out if it could not bind port 1212. Now now tries a number of ports to bind to until
     successful.
     Improvements to  unsigned casting contributed by Reini Urban.
     Improvements to Net::SSLeay::read to make it easier to use with non-blocking IO:
      contributed by James Marshall:  It modifies
      Net::SSLeay::read() to return the result from SSL_read() as the second
      return value, if Net::SSLeay::read() is called in list context.  Its
      behavior should be unchanged if called in scalar or void context.  This
      result code seems to be required for full support of non-blocking I/O,
      since users need to handle SSL_ERR_WANT_READ, SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE, etc.
      Fixed a problem where t/local/kwalitee.t fails with
       Module::CPANTS::Analyse 0.86. Patch from Paul.
      Fixed a number of typos patched by Giles.
      Fixed a compiler warning from Compiling with gcc-4.4 and -Wall, patched by Giles.	
      Fixed problems with get_https4: documentation was wrong, $header_ref was
       not correctly set and $server_cert was not returned.
      Fixed a problem that could cause a Perl exception about no blength
      method on undef. Reported by "Stephen J. Smith via RT". https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=79309 
      Added documentation about how to mitigatxe various SSL/TLS
     vulnerabilities.
     Fixed problem reported by Mike Doherty: SSL_MODE_* are defined in ssl.h, 
     and should be available as constants, but I do not see them listed in constants.h

1.48 2012-04-25
     Removed unneeded Debian_CPANTS.txt from MANIFEST.
     Fixed incorrect documentation about the best way to call CTX_set_options.
     Fixed problem that caused Undefined subroutine utf8::encode @
     t/local/33_x509_create_cert.t (on perl 5.6.2). Thanks to kmx.
     In examples and pod documentations, changed #!/usr/local/bin/perl to #!/usr/bin/perl.
     t/local/06_tcpecho.t now tries a number of ports to bind to until
     successful.

1.47 2012-04-04
     Fixed overlong lines in pod, patch from Salvatore Bonaccorso, Debian Perl
     Group
     Fixed spelling errors in pod, patch from Salvatore Bonaccorso, Debian Perl
     Group
     Fixed extra "garbage" files in 1.46 tarball. Patch from kmx.
     Fixed incorrect fail reports on some 64 bit platforms. Patch from paul.
     Fix to avoid FAIL reports from cpantesters with missing openssl
     Use my_snprintf from ppport.h to prevent link failures with perl 5.8 and
     earlier when compiled with MSVC.

1.46 2012-04-03
     Fixed a problem reported by Atoomic: 
      When bootstrapping Net::SSleay ( with DynaLoader ) if you override the SIG{DIE} signal, using 
      Net::SSLeay will result in an error.
      Recreated META.yml, added META.yml to dist
      Fixed typo: the word "corresponding" was mis-spelled as "coresponding"
       throughout the POD. Patched by kmx.
      Updated META.yml to include repository and bugtracker
     Constants cleanup - removing non existing constants (perhaps from pre-0.9.6 era) - kmx

    - 5.005_03 compat fix for Handle.pm from Jim Mintha <jim@@ic._uva.nl>
1.15  3.4.2002
        - added `use bytes' from Marcus Taylor <marcus@@semantico_.com>
          This avoids unicode/utf8 (as may appear in some XML docs)
          from fooling the length comuptations.
    - Dropped support for perl5.005_03 because I do not have opportunity 
          to test it. --Sampo
1.14  25.3.2002
    - added code to Makefile.PL to verify that the same C compiler
      is used for both perl and openssl
    - added code to Makefile.PL to support aCC on HPUX. Detective
      work contributed by Marko Asplund.
    - added peer certificate support to hilevel API, inspired
      by mock@@_obscurity.org

    - Patch by Jeremy Mates <jmates@@_mbt.washington.edu> to make Handle.pm
      more acceptable for older perls
      25.9.2001,
    - systematically implemented many of the newer functions of

    - Fixed extra-newline-if-header-already-contained-newline problem
      reported by Sean McMurray <smcmurray@verio.net> (first reported by
      Yuao TANIGAWA <yuao@@_www.infosite.ne.jp> but not fixed by me back
      then for some reason, my bad)
    - Added ability to set client certificate for https_cat and sslcat
      as suggested by Avi Ben-Harush <avib@@_atomica.com>
    - created do_https2 with more rational calling sequence
      18.7.2001,

      <eselber@@_briefcase.com>
    - bumped OpenSSL version requirement to 0.9.6b and tested
    - merged in Net::SSLeay::Handle by Jim Bowlin <jbowlin@@_linklint.org>
1.07  18.4.2001,
    - TLSv1 support by Stephen C. Koehler <koehler@@securecomputing_.com>
1.06  7.4.2001, --Sampo
    - fixed ssl_read_all bug where `0' input was mistaken for EOF.
    - openssl-0.9.6a fixes (e.g. random number generator init)
    - various minor fixes subnitted by fellow netters (sorry, I lost track
      of your names so I do not name the contributors here)
1.05  31.1.1999, --Sampo
    - fixed test cert creation (lack of symlinks, reported
          by schinder@@_pobox.com)
    - callbacks fixed and tested to work
    - added Authentication examples
    - added couple more X509_STORE_CTX family functions
1.04  31.1.1999, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@@_iki._fi>
    - Backward incompatible changes in OpenSSL API mean that 1.04 will
      drop support for SSLeay and all OpenSSL versions prior
      to 0.9.2b release. Thanks guys!
    - Detected errors in OpenSSL-0.9.2b/ssl/ssl.h - see patch in README
    - Reordered arguments of several functions to track OpenSSL-0.9.2b
      changes. This also changes the order of args in corresponding
      perl functions. You have been warned!
        - SSL_use_certificate_ASN1(s,d,len)  // swapped d and len
    - WARNING: Possibly fatal verify_callback parameter list issue
      is still standing
    - cleaned up many macros that used to access ctx->session directly,
      OpenSSL-0.9.2b defines thes macros properly so I use them now.
    - Added SSL_ctrl() and SSL_CTX_ctrl()
    - Added SSL_get_options(), SSL_CTX_get_options(),
      SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list()
    - Removed SSL_add_session(), SSL_remove_session(),
          and SSL_flush_sessions() per #if 0 in ssl.h, line 667
    - Updated paths in various utility programs
    - Upgraded version number detection logic in Makefile.PL
    - Added -rsaref flag to Makefile.PL. This allows linking against rsaref
    30.7.1999, final squeeze to get this out --Sampo
    - upgrade to OpenSSL-0.9.3a
    - upper case all header names so keys of the hash returned
      from get_https are predictible
    - fixed get_https and post_https so they don't do shutdown
      anymore. This used to cause headaches when connection
      renegotiation happened.
    - applied ssl_read_CRLF patch by Clinton Wong <clintdw@@netcom._com>
    - ActivePerl diffs from anton@@_genua.de applied,
      but not tested.
1.03  4.1.1999, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@@iki._fi>
    - Merged URI encoding patch to make_form
      from Joe Rhett <jrhett@@navigist._com>
    - changed sslcat, ssl_read_all, ssl_write_all to return error messages
      as second member of list. Functions continue to behave the old way
      if scalar return value is used (they check this with wantarray).
      Change was suggested by Joe Rhett.
    - changed $trace levels so that 0 does not produce any output
    - changed get_https and put_https to fake error 900 in $response
      return field
    - changed print_errs and some other internals to return textual
      errors instead of error count
    - changed SSLeay.xs comments from #if 0 to #define REM. This will
      hopefully make it easier to compile with some vendor compilers
    - Added version detection code for OpenSSL-0.9.1c and checked
      build
1.02  8.7.1998, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@@iki._fi>
    - Added SSL_(CTX)?_set_options and associated constants
    - Slight clean-ups
1.01  23.6.1998, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@@iki_.fi>
    - made Makefile.PL check SSLeay version and to be more CPAN kosher
    - changed build instructions to build outside perl source tree
    - added random number initialization using /dev/urandom (if available)
    - made ssl_write_all accept references, this is more memory efficient
1.00  19.6.1998, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@@_iki.fi>
    - overhauled to SSLeay-0.9.0
    - renamed cat to sslcat
    - added lots of convenience functions, like get_https
    - added couple of X509 routines
    - improved tests and documentation
    - fixed callbacks (but found that old callbacks dont work)
0.04  19.7.1996 Fixed some 0.6.1 incompatibilities, namely removed
      #include <ssl_locl.h>, fixed typo in SSL_get_cerificate, fixed
      the return type of the same. --Sampo
0.03  Renamed everything Net::SSLeay
0.02  Trial with SSL.pm name
0.01  Thu Jun 27 03:56:00 1996
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.16
